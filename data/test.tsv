neutral	The Monetary Council would continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial environment.
neutral	The Monetary Council had considered three scenarios around the baseline projection in the September Report, which, if they materialised, might influence the future stance of monetary policy.
hawkish	The deviation of inflation by 0.3 percentage points from the forecast had been caused by higher-than-expected growth in fuel prices and regulated prices.
dovish	According to these Council members, the limited risk of excessive inflationary pressure was also indicated by the decelerated growth of monetary aggregates over the recent period.
hawkish	While addressing the situation in the domestic economy, it was pointed out that some positive signals regarding the economic activity appeared recently.
hawkish	The increase was mainly due to the cumulative effects of: the persistence and amplitude of supply-side shocks, increasing pressures arising from excess demand, depreciation of the national currency and worsening inflation expectations.
neutral	During the meeting, the Board discussed and adopted the monetary policy decisions based on a report on the macroeconomic and financial developments recently recorded and anticipated for the near term, as well as on a document presenting monetary policy decisions adopted in emergency meetings by central banks in Central and Eastern Europe, and on other available domestic and external information.
hawkish	During the period since March, both inflation and core inflation have been higher than the projection in the Bank?s March Quarterly Report on Inflation.
dovish	Moreover, those members assessed that due to the possible considerable weakening of economic activity in Poland, inflation in the coming quarters might be significantly lower than assumed in the October inflation projection based on the NECMOD model.
neutral	It was said several times that the 2% inflation target was a significant anchor of inflation expectations and that a long-term undershooting of the target should not be tolerated.
hawkish	However, a bigger-than-expected spike in US inflation in April had led to a rise in global long-term yields again.
neutral	However, sentiment had been volatile, due to uncertainty about the future of unconventional measures used by global central banks, which warranted an even more cautious approach to domestic monetary policy.
dovish	While discussing the investment activity of enterprises it was pointed out that corporate investment was being curtailed due to low production capacity utilization, relatively low demand growth and high uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth as well as about changes in public finances.
neutral	In line with the new forecast, the Board also stated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. 
hawkish	There was also discussion of the observed growth in investment activity, especially in the machinery and equipment item, which is traditionally dominated by private investment.
neutral	Another major uncertainty also discussed by the Board was the evolution of wages and related nominal unit wage costs.
dovish	Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, were slowing the rise in domestic prices.
dovish	In addition to forced savings related to rising monthly instalments on loans, households? willingness to borrow may have fallen and, therefore, the sector?s net lending was likely to rise on a sustained basis.
neutral	The February 2017 foreign trade figures had been in line with the current CNB forecast.
neutral	The NBR Board analyzed the developments in the main macroeconomic indicators, in both domestic and international financial markets as well as their prospects in the context of Romania's integration in the European Union.
dovish	Several Council members noted that the latest inflation data pointed towards further cautious policy easing.
neutral	Following the review of macroeconomic and financial market developments, the Council discussed the details of the current monetary policy decision.
hawkish	Another factor suggesting a recovery of the global economy was quite high capacity utilisation in the area of commodities, whose prices might turn into a major inflationary factor again.
neutral	The general context rendered the adoption of a monetary policy decision more difficult.
hawkish	The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the upper bound of the target band over the short time horizon, as it is seen following a higher path than in the latest medium-term forecast published in the February 2019 Inflation Report.
hawkish	The expansionary impact on demand of next year?s draft budget is likely to speed up the closure of the gap.
dovish	The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB?s commitment to intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the exchange rate so as to keep the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro close to CZK 27/EUR.
neutral	According to this forecast, the domestic economy would continue to be characterised by modest recovery and stable inflation close to the 2% target.
hawkish	The real economy was at the peak of the business cycle and its current effect was assessed as inflationary.
hawkish	With a general tightening of monetary policy conditions, the cycle of base rate hikes was a definite indication to economic agents, that monetary policy was committed to low inflation. 
dovish	With respect to the situation in the labour market in Poland, attention was drawn to the continuous decline in employment growth since the beginning of the year and the decline in wage growth in the corporate sector in August 2008.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board clearly agreed that the economy was moving essentially in line with the forecast from the fifth situation report. 
hawkish	As a result, in many economies, including the euro area and the United States, inflation was reaching highest levels in decades. 
dovish	The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 further stayed on a downward trend, falling to 3.0 percent in March from 3.25 percent in December 2012.
neutral	The persistence of uncertainties related to trends in the global economy, capital flows, administered prices and volatile prices are also worth mentioning.
neutral	The opinion was expressed several times that owing to the external situation there were risks and uncertainties that were difficult to quantify. 
hawkish	Wage growth, which might be higher than forecasted, was identified as an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	It was noted that, in September, the annual increase in credit to the private sector had continued to accelerate both in nominal and real terms.
hawkish	Economic growth would be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the exchange rate of the koruna and, to a lesser extent, also fiscal policy. 
dovish	The deviation from the forecast had been due predominantly to a renewed decline in food prices, reflecting a drop in prices of food and agricultural commodities. 
dovish	While discussing interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the real ex ante rates, i.e. rates deflated with expected inflation, remained positive, which combined with the output gap remaining negative, could justify further NBP rate cuts.
hawkish	World market price of crude oil had risen to over USD 80.
dovish	While discussing the future economic situation it was assessed that the slowdown in economic growth would also be driven by a decline in consumption and export growth, and GDP growth in 2008 Q4 and in subsequent quarters would most probably be lower than anticipated in the NBP?s October projection.
dovish	It was shown that, in 2021, pronounced disinflationary influences were foreseen to come also from import prices, as well as from the base effects associated with the increases in prices of pigmeat and other agri-food commodities earlier this year.
dovish	It was pointed out that the recession in the external environment of the Polish economy and the accompanying decline in foreign demand for Polish goods had increasing impact on the activity in the domestic economy which is corroborated, among other things, by further fall in industrial output in December.
dovish	The incoming economic data had confirmed a marked deterioration in economic conditions in Poland, while the NBP November projection pointed to a risk of a protracted economic slowdown, which will curb demand pressure and pose risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term.
dovish	Several members pointed out that, as an effect of the financial market disruption, there had been a sustained fall in international investors? willingness to take risks.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, inflation developments in the coming months would continue to be shaped by upward and downward effects, and therefore there was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the short-term outlook for inflation.
hawkish	It was shown that the outlook for economic growth also assumed less accommodative monetary conditions over the projection horizon.
hawkish	The overall fundamental inflation pressures remained strong and would rise even further in the short run, owing mainly to buoyant wage growth. 
hawkish	While discussing the level of interest rates in the Polish economy, members of the Council assessed that the consolidation of the economic recovery abroad and the acceleration of economic growth in Poland, combined with further strong increases in global commodity prices and heightened inflation expectations, increased the risk of inflation running above the NBP's inflation target in the medium term.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the prospects for growth in Europe were likely to deteriorate and the economy was expected to fall into a protracted recession.
neutral	As a result, risks to the outlook for domestic inflation had become balanced again.
neutral	Council members discussed in detail the global financial market effects resulting from the outcome of the referendum on the United Kingdom's EU membership and agreed that domestic financial markets appeared to be stable despite the global turbulence.
dovish	Monetary conditions remained loose overall and, consequently, global interest rate and liquidity conditions continued to be supportive.
hawkish	The labour market was regarded as one of the major sources of inflation pressures. 
neutral	Inflation, which was being driven by one-off price deregulations and changes to tax rates, should therefore have very limited impacts on inflation expectations.
neutral	Consequently, the underlying developments could not be assessed accurately at present.
neutral	The motion did not pass.
neutral	A majority of the board members stated that the adoption of the exchange rate commitment had served its purpose.
dovish	Some members pointed out that the turbulences in financial markets resulted in lowering forecasts of economic growth in the United States and Europe.
hawkish	While addressing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed out that strong growth in wages continued to be the major risk factor for price stability
dovish	It was also said that economic growth was not creating sufficient inflationary pressures as yet and that, on the contrary, disinflationary pressures from abroad were prevailing. 
dovish	At the same time, it was emphasized that inflation forecasts had been once again revised downwards, indicating that deflation was likely to persist somewhat beyond the end of 2014.
dovish	By contrast, the downside factors included a substantially stronger exchange rate, a slightly lower expected level of economic activity in the third quarter and an outlook of somewhat slower economic growth abroad.
neutral	In assessing recent inflation developments, Council members agreed that, based on the current outlook, the inflation target could be met in 2010.
neutral	The minimum reserve ratio on leu-denominated liabilities was left unchanged.
neutral	The Council set the discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. 
dovish	Some members felt that the announcement by Moody?s that it had downgraded Hungary?s sovereign debt to sub-investment grade was an unexpected move, in light of the fact that it came after the Government had announced its intention to begin talks with the IMF.
neutral	In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the present meeting.
dovish	The rate of growth of potential output might also slow, so the lower economic growth would not necessarily have an anti-inflationary effect and consequently would not necessitate a monetary policy easing. 
hawkish	Other members of the Council pointed out that the October data on industrial production and retail sales did not signal a weakening of economic activity in Poland. 
hawkish	Decision-makers stressed that, consistent with the projection in the Inflation Report, a proactive monetary policy was necessary for inflation to stabilise around the central bank target from mid-2022.
dovish	The most recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to enter and remain in negative territory over the short term, as a result of broadening the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items and public food services as of 1 June 2015, but also amid the narrowing of the negative output gap at a quicker pace and the rise in unit labour costs.
dovish	The inflation outlook reconfirms a slowdown in both headline and core inflation in the forthcoming period.
hawkish	Some members of the Council indicated that the rise in current CPI inflation was likely to boost inflation expectations.
hawkish	Moreover, the economic expansion was seen as very likely to re-enter a decelerating trend in 2017 Q4 - 2018 Q1, with its annual dynamics remaining, however, markedly faster than in the November forecast, implying a relative increase in the positive output gap and its inflationary pressures.
hawkish	The Board said that the risk of deflation and the related likelihood of using unconventional monetary policy instruments had decreased and that the next monetary policy action would most likely be an interest rate hike.
hawkish	In the light of the effects on economic growth and inflation in the Czech Republic, the Board also discussed the pick-up in economic growth in the euro area and the related revision of the external growth prospects. 
neutral	Several members judged that the current level of interest rates was appropriate to achieve the inflation target in the medium term and ensured a corresponding degree of support to the economy. 
hawkish	On the other hand, it was repeatedly said that rates should be increased because the cost-pull inflation pressures could be sustained and because demand-pull inflation pressures might arise as a result of a faster household consumption recovery and a faster export recovery than assumed by the forecast.
neutral	The discussion revealed three different assessments of the April projection.
neutral	Before taking its policy decision on 24 October, the Council had reviewed recent developments in inflation and the macroeconomy.
hawkish	By contrast, inventories and government consumption had been more favourable than expected.
hawkish	In response to the higher inflation path and the risk of increasing second-round effects, the Monetary Council decided to continue tightening monetary conditions at a faster pace.
neutral	Other potential impact channels on the Czech economy were also mentioned in the discussion of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the future course of the US economy and the Czech Republic?s main trading partner economies. 
dovish	Some thought that the trend inflation measures, indicating a sustained fall in inflation, as well as better-than-expected readings of recent tradables inflation suggested that upside risks to inflation may have fallen since May.
neutral	The Board agreed that monetary policy decision-making was encumbered with greater uncertainty owing to the debt problems in certain countries.
dovish	While analysing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that in line with the available forecasts the CPI inflation in the coming months would be running below the NBP inflation target.
neutral	According to the new forecast, headline inflation would be just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but would return to the target at the start of 2013.
hawkish	Several members took the view that there was a significant possibility that the cost shocks would be passed through into prices and, as a result, inflation would remain above the target in 2012.
dovish	Looking at the latest relevant statistical data, Board members agreed that the main macroeconomic developments had started to reflect the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictive containment measures taken worldwide and countrywide.
neutral	Turning to real monetary conditions, Board members took the view that they had remained accommodative in 2017 Q1.
dovish	Mortgage bond purchases would take place in the primary and the secondary markets. 
dovish	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would decline below the target at the end of this year and would remain below it until the end of the forecast horizon. 
hawkish	Under these circumstances, decisive action could reinforce the role of the inflation target in guiding expectations, and consequently, they could reduce the real economic costs of achieving price stability.
hawkish	The members of the Council pointed out that in the short term inflation would be driven by rising food prices, caused by supply-side shocks in the country and abroad, changes in indirect tax rates and the rise in administered prices, primarily energy prices. 
dovish	In this context, it was also said that monetary policy, ceteris paribus, should react to lower inflation.
dovish	Global investor sentiment had been volatile in the past quarter, reflecting the Fed?s decision to further reduce the pace of its asset purchases, the increased focus on the vulnerability of some emerging economies and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
hawkish	The fast pick-up in consumption and the expected rebound in investment pave the way for a consolidation of economic growth in the period ahead.
hawkish	Furthermore, the high growth of loans indicated that the growth of domestic demand may be faster than the growth of potential GDP, which could increase the inflationary pressure.
hawkish	Wage dynamics stayed above productivity growth, emphasizing the risks of deteriorating external competitiveness and of labour cost-related inflationary pressures.
dovish	In order to ensure this, the Bank had reintroduced its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity in September.
dovish	In view of the above, Council members agreed that developments in inflation and the real economy were consistent with a further easing in monetary conditions.
dovish	Statistical estimates point to a consolidation of the disinflation process which is projected to be reflected in a slowdown of the average annual inflation rate to 5.0 percent in the coming period.
neutral	The members of the Council also devoted a lot of attention to public finance situation. 
hawkish	The Monetary Council unanimously took a decision that launching a cycle of interest rate hikes was warranted to ensure price stability, avoid persistent inflationary risks, and anchor inflation expectations.
neutral	During the meeting, the Council also addressed the April projection of inflation and GDP presented by NBP analysts and based on the ECMOD model.
neutral	The Council also discussed an optimal communication policy of the central bank?s decision-making body with the environment with a view to influencing the financial markets expectations as to the future monetary policy.
neutral	According to the updated projection, inflation rate will experience a temporarily steeper fall over the coming months and will remain thereafter inside the variation band around the flat 2.5 percent target until the end of the projection horizon.
neutral	It was said in the discussion that the lower-than-forecasted growth in food prices posed no significant downside risk to inflation, because food prices were low and the transmission of agricultural producer prices to food prices was not immediate.
neutral	The Board spent quite some time discussing the uncertainties and risks associated with developments abroad.
hawkish	Data illustrate a pick-up in private consumption and investment growth, bolstered by the recovery of lending in local currency, to households in particular, along with a sizeable advance in unit wage costs across the industrial sector.
hawkish	Other Council members, however, pointed to the rising inflation expectations in the United States.
dovish	At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to lower the CNB two-week repo rate to 3.50%, effective 8 August 2004.
hawkish	The rise had primarily been driven by the electricity price hike, as well as by fuel price developments and faster core inflation.
dovish	The NBR Board will continue to vigilantly monitor monetary and macroeconomic developments, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to ensure the maintenance of disinflation on the projected trajectory and consolidate European Union convergence, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix.
neutral	The Board discussed the risks of the forecast.
neutral	Council members could not agree as to the impact of the April and June interest rate increases on the exchange rate of the zloty.
hawkish	Moreover, they assessed that the growth in unit labour costs should be constrained by the continuation of high productivity growth related to increased investment outlays, enterprises? restructuring and improving quality of the labour force.
neutral	In contrast with these scenarios, the risk that the euro-area sovereign debt crisis would escalate had increased.
neutral	In this regard, the opinion was expressed that a large part of the deviation of inflation from the forecast was due to one-off factors that would fade away over one year.
dovish	In line with the Council?s forward guidance, the current set of instruments contributed efficiently to the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period and to an improvement in financial stability.
hawkish	Furthermore, the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the second quarter of 2019 by HUF 100 billion to at least HUF 300-500 billion and would take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments.
hawkish	Members agreed that the volatility of inflation had increased significantly in recent quarters, and therefore developments in measures of underlying inflation should continue to be closely monitored.
dovish	With inflation expectations anchored at low levels, higher oil prices were unlikely to generate second-round effects.
dovish	Net wage growth was significantly slower than gross wage growth, which, in turn, was expected to dampen domestic demand. 
hawkish	The higher-than-forecasted rise in the consumer price index might thus have been due to a combination of several factors that were not linked with monetary policy, such as shifts in the seasonality of food prices, shifts in the timing of the impacts of the increase in indirect taxes and the of the rise in regulated prices, etc.
neutral	In February 2021, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 2.6 percent level reported in December 2020.
hawkish	It was observed that the slightly faster-than-expected increase had been triggered by supply-side factors, especially the significant, larger-than-anticipated hikes in fuel prices ? amid the rise in the oil price and in the exchange rate of the leu against the US dollar ? and in tobacco product prices.
hawkish	The main inflationary factors were depreciation of the koruna and higher-than-expected average wage growth, reflected in higher nominal unit labour costs.
neutral	The Board also spent quite some time discussing the effectiveness of monetary policy during the crisis. 
hawkish	Regarding the influence of the potential slowdown abroad on the Czech economy, it was emphasised that unlike in the past the domestic growth was based to a large extent on domestic demand, so any negative external shock could be comfortably accommodated. 
hawkish	Whole-economy investment was likely to pick up further, bolstered by the increasing use of EU funding.
dovish	In addition, several members also mentioned that, according to the labour force survey, adjustment through lay-offs in the market services sector was stronger than expected, thus the increase in productivity could be higher, while the increase in unit labour costs could be lower than presumed earlier.
hawkish	Whole-economy wage growth had accelerated further, which was likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. 
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, maintaining interest rates at their current level over a sustained period was still justified.
neutral	Moreover, those members emphasised that a rise in unit labour costs does not have to lead to inflation growth, as the increase in competition connected, among other things, with the globalisation processes reduces enterprises? pricing power and, thus, their ability to pass the rising costs onto customers.
dovish	It was pointed out that the slowdown in global economic activity curbed inflationary pressure, prompting central banks of many countries to ease their monetary policy. 
neutral	Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council paid even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends.
dovish	Board members made repeated reference to the increasingly clear signs of a worsening of the euro area and global economies and to the heightened uncertainties about their outlook, especially amid the trade war and Brexit, as well as to the reaction of major central banks at such a juncture.
dovish	This deviation had been due to lower gross capital formation as a result of a deeper decline in inventories. 
hawkish	The majority of the members agreed that the balance of risks was tilted towards the upside.
neutral	The members essentially agreed that it continued to be difficult to assess the developments on the labour market.
hawkish	Board members noted that the number of employees economy-wide had continued to increase at the relatively robust pace seen a quarter earlier, while the unemployment rate had fallen by another 0.2 percentage points to a new post-crisis low.
dovish	These decisions are aimed at further strengthening the transmission of the policy rate signal, which will have a favourable impact on the credit market in domestic currency, by gradually cutting the costs related to new loans.
neutral	The current setting of the monetary conditions was assessed as roughly neutral.
hawkish	Year-on-year inflation was 6.67 percent in November 2007, remaining above the upper limit of the target band, due to a steep increase in food prices and in the tariffs of services indexed to the leu's exchange rate.
dovish	In the opinion of those Council members, GDP growth in Poland would be negatively affected also by such factors as: the deteriorating situation in the labour market, including rising unemployment and the fall in real wages in the enterprise sector, the decline in corporate loans and lending to households growing more slowly than in the last years, as well as the difficult situation of the public finance sector.
dovish	They also pointed to the symptoms of an economic weakening.
neutral	The new forecast was based on an assumption that market interest rates would be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate would be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon.
neutral	After the presentation, the Board went on to discuss the newly available information and the risks of the January forecast.
hawkish	The consumer price index was likely to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon, reflecting the effects of tax changes, administrative measures and rising commodity prices.
hawkish	Inflation would rise well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the 2% target in the quarters ahead. 
dovish	The majority of the board members also agreed that there was an increasing likelihood of commencing foreign exchange interventions in order to further ease monetary policy.
neutral	It was the unanimous view of the Council that, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation was likely to move into line with the target over the medium term.
hawkish	Members emphasised that upside risks to inflation had generally increased driven by both external and internal factors.
dovish	Council Members pointed out that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the economic situation had changed profoundly, and the outlook was deteriorating day by day.
dovish	On the other hand, however, it was said that consumer credit growth was slowing.
neutral	The NBR reiterates its commitment to the adequate use of all its available instruments, on the background of close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, with the aim of securing the achievement of its overriding objectives of medium-term price stability and the preservation of financial stability.
neutral	The external environment shows that uncertainties remain regarding the resolution of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, with impact on investors? risk aversion, capital flow volatility, as well as on global economic developments.
dovish	NBP will also offer bill discount credit intended to refinance corporate loans granted by banks.
neutral	The uncertainties about the new fiscal and budgetary measures and the implications for aggregate demand and potential GDP were, however, reiterated.
neutral	The Council, in reviewing the economic outlook, discussed in detail the alternative scenarios presented in the Report, which suggested both upside and downside risks to inflation.
neutral	Financial stability was not an issue for the Czech economy, hence there was no need to bring interest rates down to zero.
hawkish	Four members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point.
hawkish	As part of the fine-tuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, the Council made a decision to phase out the monetary policy IRS tenders and the mortgage bond purchase programme by the end of 2018.
dovish	The new forecast responded among other things to changes in the external environment, where the financial market turbulence was starting to adversely affect the economic growth of the major global economies.
hawkish	As the increased value added tax will immediately trigger a significant rise of consumer price levels - and consequently a temporary pick-up in inflation - the NBR will act to limit the second-round effects of this measure and firmly anchor inflation expectations at low levels.
neutral	Also, there was general agreement in the Council that inflation had passed its peak, as evidenced by the latest data: the trend inflation indicator, after eliminating the effects of changes in regulations, was close to levels around 3%.
hawkish	On the other hand, attention was paid to a still high growth in consumption loans.
dovish	The majority view was that the inflation target could be met on the horizon relevant for policy, given the strong disinflationary impact of significantly below-potential growth.
hawkish	Wage dynamics has stayed high while the labour market has tightened.
hawkish	Meanwhile, the increase in real monetary policy rate spread and the faster-than-anticipated appreciation of the leu, including as a result of stronger capital inflows amid favorable investor sentiment regarding emerging markets as well as in the context of Romania becoming an EU Member State, have led to tighter overall monetary conditions.
dovish	Owing to the deepening global economic crisis, the economic situation had been less favourable in this period than assumed by the previous forecast. 
hawkish	The overall inflation pressures remained strong, mainly reflecting accelerating wage growth amid robust growth of the domestic economy.
hawkish	Global economic recovery had continued in the summer months, and in parallel, inflation had risen.
neutral	 At the same time, available forecasts indicate that inflation will remain moderate in the coming quarters.
dovish	Moreover, it was noted that the widespread lockdown on activity in numerous economic sectors starting with the second part of March, in an effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pronounced drop in consumer demand, in parallel with the fall in external demand, were likely to trigger a severe contraction of the Romanian economy in Q2 and implicitly a sudden shift in its cyclical position from a significantly positive value to a strongly negative one.
hawkish	Both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation in 2012 were higher than in the baseline scenario of the previous forecast.
neutral	It was said in the discussion that monetary policy should take into account not only the attainment of the inflation target in consumer prices, but also long-term financial stability.
hawkish	August saw a slight decline in the registered unemployment rate (in seasonal adjusted terms) and a further growth in employment in the corporate sector (in monthly terms).
dovish	The aim of the meeting was to adopt, in a timely and flexible manner, stabilising monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on price and financial stability and on the Czech economy.
neutral	During the meeting the Council also discussed the levels of real interest rates and their impact on inflation.
neutral	Several members noted that, based on money market yields, the expected date of the first interest rate increase shifted later, and the overwhelming majority of analysts expected Hungarian interest rates to remain unchanged until the end of 2016 even if the Fed meanwhile raised interest rates.
neutral	The prevailing view in the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report was that the current inflation pressures were negligible, inflation expectations were well anchored and the risks of the inflation forecast were balanced.
dovish	It was mentioned that this development might be linked with cooling economic growth and falling consumer confidence abroad.
neutral	These decisions, along with the consistent implementation of commitments made by the Romanian authorities under the financing agreements with international institutions, will ensure the preservation of prospects of a sustainable resumption of disinflation and a robust recovery of the economy in the context of the nominal and real convergence process.
hawkish	While discussing current inflation, the Council analysed the causes of the annual growth of consumer prices in November running above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and exceeding the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.
dovish	The downside risks included an expected slowdown in external demand and appreciation of the koruna exchange rate.
hawkish	Whole-economy wage growth was likely to pick up further, reflecting the dynamic expansion in employment, the tight labour market and the wage agreement at the end of last year.
dovish	Nevertheless, final consumption nearly stalled, while the real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector have stayed in negative territory.
neutral	In the Monetary Council?s assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end supported price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner.
hawkish	Fiscal policy would make counter-cyclical reserves in the coming years as well.
neutral	The NBR Board has decided to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions.
hawkish	Discussions on labour market developments referred to the slightly faster rise in the number of employees economy-wide in 2016 Q4, together with the further fall in unemployment rate, which had touched a new record low in January 2017.
dovish	In this respect, several members pointed out that the expected decline of corporate production and the deterioration of profitability should result in the gradual shrinking of the balance of payments deficit, which might mitigate external vulnerability.
dovish	According to the new forecast, inflation would fall this year and would approach zero in mid-2009. 
dovish	A downside risk, by contrast, was August inflation, which at 2.4% in annual terms had come in 0.2 percentage point lower than forecasted, mainly due to adjusted inflation excluding fuels.
dovish	Monetary conditions remained loose overall and, consequently, global interest rate and liquidity conditions continued to be supportive.
