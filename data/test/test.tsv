dovish	Nevertheless, final consumption nearly stalled, while the real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector have stayed in negative territory.
neutral	The Board also spent quite some time discussing the effectiveness of monetary policy during the crisis. 
hawkish	The increase was mainly due to the cumulative effects of: the persistence and amplitude of supply-side shocks, increasing pressures arising from excess demand, depreciation of the national currency and worsening inflation expectations.
neutral	Before taking its policy decision on 24 October, the Council had reviewed recent developments in inflation and the macroeconomy.
hawkish	Global economic recovery had continued in the summer months, and in parallel, inflation had risen.
hawkish	The continued rapid increase in services prices within the headline figure for December was highly likely to have been a consequence of increased expectations.
neutral	The uncertainties about the new fiscal and budgetary measures and the implications for aggregate demand and potential GDP were, however, reiterated.
dovish	The deviation from the forecast had been due predominantly to a renewed decline in food prices, reflecting a drop in prices of food and agricultural commodities. 
hawkish	This deviation had been due to higher-than-expected growth in food prices.
neutral	The discussion revealed three different assessments of the April projection.
dovish	However, the real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory, against the background of the contraction in foreign currency credit (stocks) and the ongoing operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions? balance sheets.
hawkish	Most Council members were of the opinion that it is necessary to tighten monetary policy, yet there were different views on the right timing of the interest rates increase.
hawkish	The economic growth sped up to 4.3 percent (annual change) in 2016 Q1, following the rapid expansion of domestic absorption, mainly of consumer demand, amid higher incomes of households, the easing of the fiscal policy stance and the consolidation seen by the dynamics of private sector credit.
hawkish	In the coming quarters, domestic demand was still likely to be the main engine behind growth.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that the anti-inflationary domestic economy was affecting the labour market.
neutral	Sentiment in financial markets had been calmer recently.
neutral	Moreover, those members emphasised that a rise in unit labour costs does not have to lead to inflation growth, as the increase in competition connected, among other things, with the globalisation processes reduces enterprises? pricing power and, thus, their ability to pass the rising costs onto customers.
neutral	Following the review of macroeconomic and financial market developments, the Council discussed the details of the current monetary policy decision.
neutral	In this regard, the opinion was expressed that a large part of the deviation of inflation from the forecast was due to one-off factors that would fade away over one year.
hawkish	The members of the Council pointed out that in the short term inflation would be driven by rising food prices, caused by supply-side shocks in the country and abroad, changes in indirect tax rates and the rise in administered prices, primarily energy prices. 
dovish	In the members? judgement, the prospects for growth had not improved materially recently.
neutral	Some Council members assessed that the economic growth could stay close to previous quarters.
neutral	The motion did not pass.
neutral	The minimum reserve ratio on leu-denominated liabilities was left unchanged.
hawkish	Under such circumstances and in light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to adopt a set of measures to tighten monetary policy.
neutral	In assessing recent inflation developments, Council members agreed that, based on the current outlook, the inflation target could be met in 2010.
neutral	It was said repeatedly that the new information contained no major surprises and the forecast had largely materialised.
hawkish	Some members thought that despite the correction in June, the extent of the pick-up in wage growth posed an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	Four members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point.
hawkish	It was shown that the outlook for economic growth also assumed less accommodative monetary conditions over the projection horizon.
dovish	At the same time, the Council decided to introduce, starting on 1 January 2010, the discount rate on bills of exchange accepted from commercial banks for discount at the NBP.
dovish	In line with the Council?s forward guidance, the current set of instruments contributed efficiently to the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period and to an improvement in financial stability.
dovish	Board members made repeated reference to the increasingly clear signs of a worsening of the euro area and global economies and to the heightened uncertainties about their outlook, especially amid the trade war and Brexit, as well as to the reaction of major central banks at such a juncture.
dovish	Those members pointed out that the likely slowdown in the world economy might lead to a slowdown in economic growth in Poland.
hawkish	Some members of the Council emphasized, however, that changes in VAT rates might boost inflation expectations.
hawkish	Members emphasised that upside risks to inflation had generally increased driven by both external and internal factors.
neutral	Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged for a longer period of time, i.e. at least until the end of the third quarter of 2014.
hawkish	The board members also agreed that the future increase in interest rates would help mitigate the risks associated with growth in mortgage loans, to which the CNB had already reacted primarily with macroprudential instruments.
neutral	The February 2017 foreign trade figures had been in line with the current CNB forecast.
neutral	After discussing the situation report, the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the CNB two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.75%. 
hawkish	While addressing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed out that strong growth in wages continued to be the major risk factor for price stability
dovish	It was mentioned that this development might be linked with cooling economic growth and falling consumer confidence abroad.
neutral	Looking forward, the Bank would adjust the monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments: swaps providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. 
hawkish	While discussing current inflation, the Council analysed the causes of the annual growth of consumer prices in November running above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and exceeding the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.
dovish	According to some members of the Council, the above mentioned factors, namely reduced external and domestic demand (both consumer and investment demand) would result in GDP growth being considerably lower than accounted for in the February projection.
dovish	The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB?s commitment to intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the exchange rate so as to keep the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro close to CZK 27/EUR.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the economic data becoming available in the past month suggested that subdued demand continued to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices.
hawkish	Furthermore, the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the second quarter of 2019 by HUF 100 billion to at least HUF 300-500 billion and would take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments.
neutral	In this context, it was still emphasized that the incoming data on economic activity and inflationary processes in Poland in the coming months, as well as the NBP March projection, would be helpful in assessing the outlook for medium-term growth and inflation.
hawkish	Moreover, they assessed that the growth in unit labour costs should be constrained by the continuation of high productivity growth related to increased investment outlays, enterprises? restructuring and improving quality of the labour force.
neutral	According to this forecast, the domestic economy would continue to be characterised by modest recovery and stable inflation close to the 2% target.
dovish	This deviation had been due to lower gross capital formation as a result of a deeper decline in inventories. 
hawkish	As part of the fine-tuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, the Council made a decision to phase out the monetary policy IRS tenders and the mortgage bond purchase programme by the end of 2018.
hawkish	Robust growth in household consumption was continuing, in conditions of accelerating wage and employment growth and persisting consumer optimism.
hawkish	Meanwhile, the increase in real monetary policy rate spread and the faster-than-anticipated appreciation of the leu, including as a result of stronger capital inflows amid favorable investor sentiment regarding emerging markets as well as in the context of Romania becoming an EU Member State, have led to tighter overall monetary conditions.
neutral	Moreover, further policy easing is not warranted, and it would only facilitate economic growth to a barely perceptible degree.
dovish	A downside risk, by contrast, was August inflation, which at 2.4% in annual terms had come in 0.2 percentage point lower than forecasted, mainly due to adjusted inflation excluding fuels.
neutral	The general context rendered the adoption of a monetary policy decision more difficult.
neutral	At the start of the meeting, the Board was informed about the latest macroeconomic indicators.
neutral	The NBR Board analyzed the developments in the main macroeconomic indicators, in both domestic and international financial markets as well as their prospects in the context of Romania's integration in the European Union.
dovish	It was pointed out that the recession in the external environment of the Polish economy and the accompanying decline in foreign demand for Polish goods had increasing impact on the activity in the domestic economy which is corroborated, among other things, by further fall in industrial output in December.
dovish	While discussing interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the real ex ante rates, i.e. rates deflated with expected inflation, remained positive, which combined with the output gap remaining negative, could justify further NBP rate cuts.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, inflation developments in the coming months would continue to be shaped by upward and downward effects, and therefore there was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the short-term outlook for inflation.
neutral	The new forecast was based on an assumption that market interest rates would be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate would be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon.
dovish	In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which foresees a decline in inflation rate to all-time lows in the first half of 2014, amid the ongoing transitory impact of this year's crops and the lower VAT rate for some bakery products.
hawkish	Wage growth, which might be higher than forecasted, was identified as an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	However, a bigger-than-expected spike in US inflation in April had led to a rise in global long-term yields again.
hawkish	The majority of the members agreed that the balance of risks was tilted towards the upside.
dovish	The new forecast responded among other things to changes in the external environment, where the financial market turbulence was starting to adversely affect the economic growth of the major global economies.
hawkish	It was also said that the rapid wage growth constituted a positive contribution to financial stability, because it was increasing households? ability to repay their loans. The high GDP growth rate was likewise debated.
neutral	Moreover, the discussants pointed out that the situation in international financial markets had stabilised to some extent.
dovish	These decisions are aimed at further strengthening the transmission of the policy rate signal, which will have a favourable impact on the credit market in domestic currency, by gradually cutting the costs related to new loans.
neutral	In the Monetary Council?s assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end supported price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner.
hawkish	The overall inflation pressures remained strong, mainly reflecting accelerating wage growth amid robust growth of the domestic economy.
neutral	Domestic economic developments were broadly in line with the forecast and the deviations from the forecast were so far small and in both directions.
hawkish	The fast pick-up in consumption and the expected rebound in investment pave the way for a consolidation of economic growth in the period ahead.
hawkish	Moreover, the economic expansion was seen as very likely to re-enter a decelerating trend in 2017 Q4 - 2018 Q1, with its annual dynamics remaining, however, markedly faster than in the November forecast, implying a relative increase in the positive output gap and its inflationary pressures.
hawkish	Demand-supply frictions, emerging temporarily due to the rapid restart of the domestic economy, and the renewed tightening of labour market capacities expected in certain sectors, combined with dynamic wage growth, had increased inflation risks.
dovish	Monetary conditions remained loose overall and, consequently, global interest rate and liquidity conditions continued to be supportive.
neutral	Before taking a decision on interest rates, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest macroeconomic and financial market developments and discussed the June issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation produced by MNB staff.
dovish	According to these Council members, the limited risk of excessive inflationary pressure was also indicated by the decelerated growth of monetary aggregates over the recent period.
hawkish	It was said that the external environment - for instance the increase in the euro area growth estimate, but also the latest data on higher oil prices than expected in the forecast - could become an inflationary factor. 
dovish	Several Council members noted that the latest inflation data pointed towards further cautious policy easing.
hawkish	Under these circumstances, decisive action could reinforce the role of the inflation target in guiding expectations, and consequently, they could reduce the real economic costs of achieving price stability.
hawkish	The rising share of household consumption in GDP was mentioned as a moderate upside risk.
hawkish	Decision-makers stressed that, consistent with the projection in the Inflation Report, a proactive monetary policy was necessary for inflation to stabilise around the central bank target from mid-2022.
dovish	In the opinion of some members of the Council this course of future inflation will follow from weaker consumption demand, persistently low wage pressure and the appreciation of nominal zloty exchange rate so far.
hawkish	At the close of the meeting the Board decided to increase the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 %, effective 1 June 2007.
neutral	 At the same time, available forecasts indicate that inflation will remain moderate in the coming quarters.
neutral	After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the new distribution of the risks relating to the October forecast and its implications for monetary policy.
hawkish	Members agreed that the volatility of inflation had increased significantly in recent quarters, and therefore developments in measures of underlying inflation should continue to be closely monitored.
dovish	On the other hand, however, it was said that consumer credit growth was slowing.
hawkish	Economic growth - supported by a solid rise in investment and, to a lesser extent, by an advance in consumption - has remained fast at 7.7 percent, while the persistence of excess demand has triggered a wider current account deficit.
hawkish	While discussing the level of interest rates in the Polish economy, members of the Council assessed that the consolidation of the economic recovery abroad and the acceleration of economic growth in Poland, combined with further strong increases in global commodity prices and heightened inflation expectations, increased the risk of inflation running above the NBP's inflation target in the medium term.
dovish	Some members pointed out that the turbulences in financial markets resulted in lowering forecasts of economic growth in the United States and Europe.
hawkish	In response to the higher inflation path and the risk of increasing second-round effects, the Monetary Council decided to continue tightening monetary conditions at a faster pace.
dovish	While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the signs of stronger and faster than expected decline in the global and Polish economic activity combined with considerable lowering of the inflationary pressure in the medium term speak for decreasing the NBP interest rates.
dovish	Council Members pointed out that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the economic situation had changed profoundly, and the outlook was deteriorating day by day.
dovish	Net wage growth was significantly slower than gross wage growth, which, in turn, was expected to dampen domestic demand. 
dovish	The majority view of the Council was that it was time to act in the interests of growth.
dovish	In the monetary area it is worth noting the continued slowdown in real terms of the annual dynamics of credit to the private sector, especially of the leu-denominated component, amid still weak demand for loans against the background of the recession.
hawkish	Rising household real income as a result of low inflation, the reduced need for deleveraging and increasing employment were expected to contribute to the increase in household consumption.
dovish	Based on data for the third quarter, economic activity had undergone a significant correction after reaching a low point in April and May.
neutral	Members agreed that developments in euro area monetary conditions were of prime importance for the Magyar Nemzeti Bank?s monetary policy.
dovish	Owing to the deepening global economic crisis, the economic situation had been less favourable in this period than assumed by the previous forecast. 
hawkish	Regarding the influence of the potential slowdown abroad on the Czech economy, it was emphasised that unlike in the past the domestic growth was based to a large extent on domestic demand, so any negative external shock could be comfortably accommodated. 
hawkish	While addressing the situation in the domestic economy, it was pointed out that some positive signals regarding the economic activity appeared recently.
dovish	A role had been played by the new definition of the consumer basket and lower-than-expected inflation in a number of segments.
hawkish	The Board said that the risk of deflation and the related likelihood of using unconventional monetary policy instruments had decreased and that the next monetary policy action would most likely be an interest rate hike.
hawkish	The deviation of inflation by 0.3 percentage points from the forecast had been caused by higher-than-expected growth in fuel prices and regulated prices.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that it was appropriate to leave interest rates unchanged.
dovish	Several other members noted that not only supply factors, but also demand factors could explain the recent slowdown in economic growth, which, in turn, could dampen the disinflationary effects of lower growth.
neutral	The prevailing view in the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report was that the current inflation pressures were negligible, inflation expectations were well anchored and the risks of the inflation forecast were balanced.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, a cautious approach to policy was warranted due to uncertainty related to the global financial environment.
hawkish	Whole-economy wage growth was likely to pick up further, reflecting the dynamic expansion in employment, the tight labour market and the wage agreement at the end of last year.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, maintaining interest rates at their current level over a sustained period was still justified.
hawkish	Economic growth would be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the exchange rate of the koruna and, to a lesser extent, also fiscal policy. 
hawkish	Some members of the Council indicated that the rise in current CPI inflation was likely to boost inflation expectations.
dovish	The decline in private consumption growth will be driven by the anticipated deterioration of the labour market situation indicated by the November data on the declining wage growth and falling employment in the enterprise sector and increasing unemployment as well as tightening of household lending criteria.
dovish	Fiscal policy could therefore foster lower economic growth and lower inflation next year. 
hawkish	Other members of the Council pointed out that the October data on industrial production and retail sales did not signal a weakening of economic activity in Poland. 
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, risks to inflation remained both on the upside and the downside.
neutral	It was said in the discussion that the lower-than-forecasted growth in food prices posed no significant downside risk to inflation, because food prices were low and the transmission of agricultural producer prices to food prices was not immediate.
neutral	In view of the experiences gained from the first tender, the Bank had fine-tuned the details of the programme to achieve more effective monetary transmission, as a result of which tenders held in February had been in line with the Bank?s aims.
hawkish	As a result, in many economies, including the euro area and the United States, inflation was reaching highest levels in decades. 
neutral	Members agreed that the Bank should adopt a very cautious approach to setting interest rates.
dovish	Moreover, those members assessed that due to the possible considerable weakening of economic activity in Poland, inflation in the coming quarters might be significantly lower than assumed in the October inflation projection based on the NECMOD model.
hawkish	On the other hand, it was repeatedly said that rates should be increased because the cost-pull inflation pressures could be sustained and because demand-pull inflation pressures might arise as a result of a faster household consumption recovery and a faster export recovery than assumed by the forecast.
dovish	The analysis of the most recent statistics show a slowdown of economic growth as a result of reduction in both exports and external financing against the background of deepening global economic and financial crisis.
neutral	Several members judged that the current level of interest rates was appropriate to achieve the inflation target in the medium term and ensured a corresponding degree of support to the economy. 
neutral	According to the new forecast, headline inflation would be just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but would return to the target at the start of 2013.
neutral	Some Board members underlined that inflation developments in 2018 had validated the NBR forecasts and the central bank?s monetary policy conduct which had not overreacted to the significant rise seen by the annual inflation rate in the summer months.
dovish	The prolonged real negative annual dynamics of credit to the private sector is worth noting.
hawkish	When analysing the situation in the labour market, it was pointed out that the data on wages in the enterprise sector in February were higher then expected, and the growth of employment remained at a high level.
neutral	Also, there was general agreement in the Council that inflation had passed its peak, as evidenced by the latest data: the trend inflation indicator, after eliminating the effects of changes in regulations, was close to levels around 3%.
dovish	Several members pointed out that sentiment towards Hungary had deteriorated, which contributed to the rise in the risk premium for holding forint denominated assets.
neutral	Consequently, the underlying developments could not be assessed accurately at present.
dovish	External inflation, particularly in the euro area, was likely to remain low for a prolonged period.
dovish	Additionally, they argued that consolidating lowering the NBP interest rates to the level consistent with both maintaining price stability and supporting economic activity, would be conducive to fading of expectations for further NBP interest rates reductions, which should limit the pressure for zloty depreciation.
dovish	In view of the above, Council members agreed that developments in inflation and the real economy were consistent with a further easing in monetary conditions.
dovish	The downside risks included an expected slowdown in external demand and appreciation of the koruna exchange rate.
dovish	The aim of the meeting was to adopt, in a timely and flexible manner, stabilising monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on price and financial stability and on the Czech economy.
dovish	The risks associated with the medium-term inflation outlook are primarily related to foreign capital flow volatility, owing to cross-border deleveraging across the banking system and to the variability of investors? risk appetite also following the decisions of the major central banks across the globe.
neutral	Developments in the Bank?s measures of underlying inflation had remained stable, in line with expectations.
dovish	With inflation expectations anchored at low levels, higher oil prices were unlikely to generate second-round effects.
hawkish	The comparatively high growth in the money supply, driven mainly by growth in currency in circulation, was also mentioned as a partial upside inflation factor.
hawkish	The analysis of the most recent statistics show an increase in the annual inflation.
hawkish	In the light of the effects on economic growth and inflation in the Czech Republic, the Board also discussed the pick-up in economic growth in the euro area and the related revision of the external growth prospects. 
dovish	The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 further stayed on a downward trend, falling to 3.0 percent in March from 3.25 percent in December 2012.
dovish	Monetary conditions remained loose overall and, consequently, global interest rate and liquidity conditions continued to be supportive.
dovish	Based on employment data, labour market conditions had eased.
hawkish	A majority of the board members agreed that economic growth would continue to be robust over the forecast horizon.
neutral	The Council, in reviewing the economic outlook, discussed in detail the alternative scenarios presented in the Report, which suggested both upside and downside risks to inflation.
hawkish	The higher-than-forecasted rise in the consumer price index might thus have been due to a combination of several factors that were not linked with monetary policy, such as shifts in the seasonality of food prices, shifts in the timing of the impacts of the increase in indirect taxes and the of the rise in regulated prices, etc.
neutral	The Council also discussed an optimal communication policy of the central bank?s decision-making body with the environment with a view to influencing the financial markets expectations as to the future monetary policy.
dovish	The Board also discussed the observed cooling of international trade, which was fuelling concerns of a potential stronger global growth slowdown.
dovish	The majority view was that the inflation target could be met on the horizon relevant for policy, given the strong disinflationary impact of significantly below-potential growth.
hawkish	The consumer price index was likely to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon, reflecting the effects of tax changes, administrative measures and rising commodity prices.
dovish	However, with the easing in global financial turbulence and the conclusion of the agreement with the IMF, the Bank should have more scope to reduce interest rates.
neutral	While discussing interest rates, the Council assessed that they should remain unchanged.
dovish	While discussing the changes in the environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that there were downward revisions of the forecasts of economic growth in the United States and the European Union and that there was a risk of a deceleration in worldwide economic growth, which may slow the growth of Polish exports and the inflow of direct investments and, consequently, reduce the rate of economic growth in Poland.
hawkish	In the medium-term, upside risks to inflation remain significant, coming mainly from the timing and magnitude of administered price adjustments, the volatility of capital flows amid developments in the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union and the United States, as well as uncertainties regarding the evolution of global commodity prices.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate picked up in September 2012.
hawkish	They emphasized that the balance of risks for short-term NBP inflation forecasts was asymmetrical and pointed to a greater risk of higher inflation than would follow up from the central path. 
hawkish	The real economy was at the peak of the business cycle and its current effect was assessed as inflationary.
neutral	The NBR reiterates its commitment to the adequate use of all its available instruments, on the background of close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments, with the aim of securing the achievement of its overriding objectives of medium-term price stability and the preservation of financial stability.
hawkish	As a result, over the monetary policy transmission horizon, wage pressure in the economy may be expected to intensify. 
neutral	However, sentiment had been volatile, due to uncertainty about the future of unconventional measures used by global central banks, which warranted an even more cautious approach to domestic monetary policy.
neutral	During the meeting, the Board discussed and adopted the monetary policy decision, based on the data and analyses on current and expected macroeconomic, financial and monetary developments submitted by the specialised departments and other available domestic and external information.
hawkish	A majority of the board members assessed the risks and uncertainties of the summer forecast as being markedly inflationary and hence requiring a faster rise in interest rates compared with the current forecast.
neutral	Economic activity might begin to normalise from the second quarter of 2021 as the coronavirus vaccine became widely available.
hawkish	Some Council members pointed to a continually high rate of wage growth and to a very fast drop in unemployment, facilitating a further strong rise in wages.
dovish	However, the opinion was also expressed that production capacity was not yet fully utilised and the domestic economy was ceasing to be anti-inflationary rather than having a stronger inflationary effect. 
hawkish	One member noted that the significant increase in the minimum wage could add to cost- push inflationary pressure.
hawkish	The recovery of the Romanian economy has continued ? underpinned by favourable dynamics of exports, as well as of industrial and farming output.
hawkish	It was therefore more appropriate to raise interest rates gradually from the financial stability point of view as well.
neutral	The Monetary Council had considered three scenarios around the baseline projection in the September Report, which, if they materialised, might influence the future stance of monetary policy.
dovish	While discussing the future economic situation it was assessed that the slowdown in economic growth would also be driven by a decline in consumption and export growth, and GDP growth in 2008 Q4 and in subsequent quarters would most probably be lower than anticipated in the NBP?s October projection.
hawkish	Mention was also made of risks stemming from developments in the euro area, where a relatively strong economic recovery ? confirmed by leading indicators ? was expected.
neutral	Economic growth was forecasted at approximately 5.3% in 2007 and 4.8% in 2008
hawkish	During the discussions on future developments, Board members noted that the current short-term forecast reconfirmed the outlook for the annual inflation rate to pick up slightly in the following months.
hawkish	By contrast, inventories and government consumption had been more favourable than expected.
neutral	However, certain Council members pointed out that despite better economic conditions in the euro area, growth in this economy remained relatively weak.
hawkish	The main inflationary factors were depreciation of the koruna and higher-than-expected average wage growth, reflected in higher nominal unit labour costs.
dovish	While analysing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that in line with the available forecasts the CPI inflation in the coming months would be running below the NBP inflation target.
neutral	At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that the developments of HIPC inflation in Poland against the reference value for price stability criterion in the coming years would largely depend upon changes in regulated prices.
hawkish	According to labour market data for March, demand for labour had increased and unemployment had fallen, pointing to a tighter labour market going forward.
hawkish	This was in response to the current exceptionally strong inflation pressures in the domestic and foreign economies.
dovish	It was also said that economic growth was not creating sufficient inflationary pressures as yet and that, on the contrary, disinflationary pressures from abroad were prevailing. 
neutral	It was said in the discussion that if the standard interest rate instrument were available, its use would lead to a faster return of inflation to the 2% inflation target.
dovish	This occurred as an effect of constraints related to higher external financing costs amid marked volatility on world financial markets, of a continued trend of gradual reduction in excess liquidity in the banking system and of the central bank shifting towards a creditor position in its relation with credit institutions.
neutral	The exchange rate of the koruna and interest rates were in line with the forecast.
neutral	The Board spent quite some time discussing the uncertainties and risks associated with developments abroad.
neutral	Broad monetary conditions remained adequate for fulfilling the medium-term inflation target as the monetary policy stance stayed prudent.
dovish	The MNB would be ready to increase its balance sheet further to manage risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic and to foster the quick and sustainable recovery of economic growth in a targeted way.
dovish	Interbank rates on the money market and bank rates continued to decrease to new historical lows
dovish	Slow GDP growth in Germany ? Poland?s main trading partner ? was highlighted, along with the decline in the PMI index for that country.
dovish	The newly available information suggested that the risks to inflation in relation to the February forecast were on both the upside and the downside, but had moved towards the downside overall.
dovish	According to the new forecast, inflation would fall this year and would approach zero in mid-2009. 
hawkish	During the period since March, both inflation and core inflation have been higher than the projection in the Bank?s March Quarterly Report on Inflation.
hawkish	On the whole, international investor sentiment had been favourable in the period since the Council?s latest interest rate decision.
neutral	In the Board members? assessment, the external environment also continued to pose two-way risks to the inflation forecast.
dovish	In the opinion of some Council members the considerable deterioration of the outlook for economic growth in Poland spoke for lowering interest rates by 50 basis points at the November meeting.
neutral	Council members discussed in detail the global financial market effects resulting from the outcome of the referendum on the United Kingdom's EU membership and agreed that domestic financial markets appeared to be stable despite the global turbulence.
dovish	Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, were slowing the rise in domestic prices.
hawkish	GDP growth gathered momentum in 2015 Q3.
hawkish	Some Council members assessed that the persistently high growth in lending will support strong increase in private consumption, and consequently, in aggregate demand and inflation.
hawkish	The Monetary Council agreed that the upside risks to inflation might persist longer than previously expected.
dovish	The Monetary Council expected that this decision would mean the crowding out of at least HUF 100- 200 billion additional liquidity from the deposit facility.
dovish	However, the latest domestic and international data on real economic performance had caused a negative surprise worldwide.
hawkish	It was said that information from the labour market was confirming the forecast of strong domestic demand growth, and the observed growth of the money supply was also mentioned as an upside factor.
neutral	The Council assessed that, despite favourable economic conditions and good labour market conditions, inflationary pressure remained limited and there were no imbalances building up in the economy.
neutral	The aggregate real broad monetary conditions have been permanently calibrated so as to achieve a consolidation of prospects for the inflation rate to continuously remain within the variation band around the target, thus helping the efforts to efficiently anchor anticipations and underpinnings for sustainable economic growth.
neutral	At the same time, the Board stated that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors, and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility.
dovish	Several members pointed out that, as an effect of the financial market disruption, there had been a sustained fall in international investors? willingness to take risks.
hawkish	Opinions were expressed that a more optimistic outlook for euro area growth and expectations of further ECB interest rate increases - together with their implications for domestic exchange rate developments - were moderate upside risks. 
neutral	Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserved financial stability and supported the Government?s economic policy.
dovish	In addition, several members also mentioned that, according to the labour force survey, adjustment through lay-offs in the market services sector was stronger than expected, thus the increase in productivity could be higher, while the increase in unit labour costs could be lower than presumed earlier.
hawkish	Furthermore, the high growth of loans indicated that the growth of domestic demand may be faster than the growth of potential GDP, which could increase the inflationary pressure.
hawkish	Credit markets had continued to expand strongly even in international comparison.
hawkish	The expansionary impact on demand of next year?s draft budget is likely to speed up the closure of the gap.
neutral	Financial stability was not an issue for the Czech economy, hence there was no need to bring interest rates down to zero.
neutral	Board members concluded that the cumulated effects of those measures were difficult to assess at the current stage, considering a series of ambiguities and the multitude of transmission channels in the economy, conducive to a heightened degree of uncertainty surrounding the current forecast.
dovish	Looking at the latest relevant statistical data, Board members agreed that the main macroeconomic developments had started to reflect the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the restrictive containment measures taken worldwide and countrywide.
dovish	The domestic economy was continuing to decline from the peak of the business cycle.
neutral	The members of the Council also devoted a lot of attention to public finance situation. 
dovish	Global investor sentiment had been volatile in the past quarter, reflecting the Fed?s decision to further reduce the pace of its asset purchases, the increased focus on the vulnerability of some emerging economies and the escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
neutral	The external environment shows that uncertainties remain regarding the resolution of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, with impact on investors? risk aversion, capital flow volatility, as well as on global economic developments.
neutral	The opinion was expressed that rates should remain unchanged in view of the new inflation target.
hawkish	Members pointed out that the latest data showed inflation rising at a higher-than-expected rate, due to increases in processed food prices.
hawkish	One member warned that food prices could rise more strongly at home than internationally. 
hawkish	The faster economic growth in 2015 Q3 (3.6 percent) was stoked up by rising private consumption, amid higher nominal income of households, the lending recovery, lower indirect taxation and stronger confidence in the economy.
hawkish	August saw a slight decline in the registered unemployment rate (in seasonal adjusted terms) and a further growth in employment in the corporate sector (in monthly terms).
neutral	A majority of the board members stated that the adoption of the exchange rate commitment had served its purpose.
hawkish	The overall fundamental inflation pressures remained strong and would rise even further in the short run, owing mainly to buoyant wage growth. 
dovish	The rate of growth of potential output might also slow, so the lower economic growth would not necessarily have an anti-inflationary effect and consequently would not necessitate a monetary policy easing. 
neutral	In support of maintaining the current level of monetary policy rates, it was repeatedly argued that it was risky to make monetary policy changes in an environment of major uncertainty, which is heading in both directions.
neutral	Volatility remained extremely elevated.
dovish	Compared to the previous macroeconomic forecast from October last year, expected inflation and forecast-consistent interest rates had been revised downwards. 
hawkish	The same data indicated private consumption as the engine of the robust economic growth in 2017 Q2.
dovish	In turn, few Council members assessed that the current level of the NBP interest rates ? given the signs of a possible significant economic downturn and the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term ? is too high and thus may lead to excessive deceleration of economic growth.
neutral	The opinion was expressed several times that owing to the external situation there were risks and uncertainties that were difficult to quantify. 
dovish	In addition to forced savings related to rising monthly instalments on loans, households? willingness to borrow may have fallen and, therefore, the sector?s net lending was likely to rise on a sustained basis.
hawkish	The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the upper bound of the target band over the short time horizon, as it is seen following a higher path than in the latest medium-term forecast published in the February 2019 Inflation Report.
dovish	Moreover, it was noted that the widespread lockdown on activity in numerous economic sectors starting with the second part of March, in an effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pronounced drop in consumer demand, in parallel with the fall in external demand, were likely to trigger a severe contraction of the Romanian economy in Q2 and implicitly a sudden shift in its cyclical position from a significantly positive value to a strongly negative one.
hawkish	World market price of crude oil had risen to over USD 80.
neutral	It was said several times that the 2% inflation target was a significant anchor of inflation expectations and that a long-term undershooting of the target should not be tolerated.
neutral	Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council paid even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends.
dovish	This would be due mainly to a fall in government investment as a result of an only gradual start to the drawdown of EU funds in the new programme period.
dovish	In this context, it was also said that monetary policy, ceteris paribus, should react to lower inflation.
neutral	Similarly, inflation developments were also determined by opposing forces.
neutral	During the meeting, the Board discussed and adopted the monetary policy decisions based on a report on the macroeconomic and financial developments recently recorded and anticipated for the near term, as well as on a document presenting monetary policy decisions adopted in emergency meetings by central banks in Central and Eastern Europe, and on other available domestic and external information.
dovish	Some members felt that the announcement by Moody?s that it had downgraded Hungary?s sovereign debt to sub-investment grade was an unexpected move, in light of the fact that it came after the Government had announced its intention to begin talks with the IMF.
hawkish	Several members noted that anchoring inflation expectations, i.e. keeping inflationary pressures from taking hold with the economic recovery, was becoming a key issue as demand picked up. 
dovish	It was shown that, in 2021, pronounced disinflationary influences were foreseen to come also from import prices, as well as from the base effects associated with the increases in prices of pigmeat and other agri-food commodities earlier this year.
neutral	Several members noted that, based on money market yields, the expected date of the first interest rate increase shifted later, and the overwhelming majority of analysts expected Hungarian interest rates to remain unchanged until the end of 2016 even if the Fed meanwhile raised interest rates.
dovish	At the same time, both real annual dynamics of other leading indicators of domestic demand and the evolution in real terms of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory.
dovish	In the alternative scenario assuming a persistently low external inflation environment and a slower-than- expected recovery in external demand, the inflation target might be achieved with looser monetary conditions than assumed in the baseline scenario.
dovish	In order to ensure this, the Bank had reintroduced its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity in September.
neutral	The short-term outlook indicates risks related to evolutions in administered and volatile food prices, in a seasonal context and due to base effects, as well as the persistence of uncertainties regarding the impact of fiscal consolidation measures, which, amid the current domestic social and political developments, require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance in a bid to firmly anchor inflation expectations.
dovish	With respect to the situation in the labour market in Poland, attention was drawn to the continuous decline in employment growth since the beginning of the year and the decline in wage growth in the corporate sector in August 2008.
hawkish	Wage dynamics has stayed high while the labour market has tightened.
neutral	Turning to real monetary conditions, Board members took the view that they had remained accommodative in 2017 Q1.
hawkish	The expected rise in energy prices would lead to higher inflation expectations.
hawkish	Whole-economy wage growth had accelerated further, which was likely to raise core inflation gradually through rising household consumption. 
dovish	While discussing monetary policy abroad, it was stressed that major central banks continued to pursue highly expansionary monetary policy. 
hawkish	Board members agreed that, based on the new data and assessments, a robust economic growth in annual terms was also expected in the first half of 2019, amid some mild fluctuations in the quarterly growth, so that the positive output gap would likely grow in that period in line with the February forecast.
neutral	During the meeting, the Council also addressed the April projection of inflation and GDP presented by NBP analysts and based on the ECMOD model.
dovish	Nevertheless, the overall inflation pressures in the domestic economy were easing somewhat, due mainly to a decline in import prices.
neutral	It was the unanimous view of the Council that, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation was likely to move into line with the target over the medium term.
dovish	By contrast, the downside factors included a substantially stronger exchange rate, a slightly lower expected level of economic activity in the third quarter and an outlook of somewhat slower economic growth abroad.
neutral	Another major uncertainty also discussed by the Board was the evolution of wages and related nominal unit wage costs.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the prospects for growth in Europe were likely to deteriorate and the economy was expected to fall into a protracted recession.
neutral	During the meeting the Council also discussed the levels of real interest rates and their impact on inflation.
dovish	The incoming economic data had confirmed a marked deterioration in economic conditions in Poland, while the NBP November projection pointed to a risk of a protracted economic slowdown, which will curb demand pressure and pose risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term.
neutral	According to the updated projection, inflation rate will experience a temporarily steeper fall over the coming months and will remain thereafter inside the variation band around the flat 2.5 percent target until the end of the projection horizon.
neutral	The outlook for growth had remained persistently muted.
neutral	The stabilisation of inflation expectations around the target was likely to ensure that price and wage-setting would be consistent with the inflation target over the medium term as domestic demand growth strengthened.
hawkish	On the other hand, attention was paid to a still high growth in consumption loans.
dovish	In the opinion of those Council members, GDP growth in Poland would be negatively affected also by such factors as: the deteriorating situation in the labour market, including rising unemployment and the fall in real wages in the enterprise sector, the decline in corporate loans and lending to households growing more slowly than in the last years, as well as the difficult situation of the public finance sector.
neutral	Secondly, other factors which suggested some upward pressure on inflation mainly reflected one-off price shocks and, particularly as regards wage data, changes in the regulatory environment.
hawkish	Fiscal policy would make counter-cyclical reserves in the coming years as well.
hawkish	In the opinion of those Council members, this may indicate that a time might be approaching for considering a change in the assessment of probabilities of inflation in the medium term running below or above the inflation target and, possibly, the subsequent monetary policy tightening.
neutral	During 2014, the exchange rate of the leu against the euro witnessed stable developments.
dovish	At its current policy meeting, to maintain price stability and to support the restoration of economic growth, the Monetary Council had reduced the base rate by 15 basis points to 0.60 percent.
hawkish	Whole-economy investment was likely to pick up further, bolstered by the increasing use of EU funding.
dovish	It was pointed out that the slowdown in global economic activity curbed inflationary pressure, prompting central banks of many countries to ease their monetary policy. 
dovish	The financial crisis in some segments of the international credit market could lead to a downswing in European economic growth.
neutral	The NBR Board has decided to pursue an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions.
hawkish	The improvement in economic activity in Romania has further been fostered by the favourable performance of industrial output, fuelled mainly by external demand growth and the gradually rebounding domestic demand, amid a further narrow current account deficit.
neutral	The Board agreed that monetary policy decision-making was encumbered with greater uncertainty owing to the debt problems in certain countries.
hawkish	The growing domestic economy was fostering higher inflation
neutral	Board members deemed that real monetary conditions had remained highly accommodative in July and August.
hawkish	It was indicated that wage growth continued to exceed labour productivity growth, which was conducive to growing inflationary pressure.
hawkish	Discussions on labour market developments referred to the slightly faster rise in the number of employees economy-wide in 2016 Q4, together with the further fall in unemployment rate, which had touched a new record low in January 2017.
dovish	At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to lower the CNB two-week repo rate to 3.50%, effective 8 August 2004.
neutral	In contrast with these scenarios, the risk that the euro-area sovereign debt crisis would escalate had increased.
neutral	The persistence of uncertainties related to trends in the global economy, capital flows, administered prices and volatile prices are also worth mentioning.
dovish	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would decline below the target at the end of this year and would remain below it until the end of the forecast horizon. 
dovish	At the same time, it was emphasized that inflation forecasts had been once again revised downwards, indicating that deflation was likely to persist somewhat beyond the end of 2014.
hawkish	The majority of Monetary Council members judged that inflation was likely to be considerably above the Bank?s 3% target in the coming quarters, due to the significant cost shocks hitting the economy.
hawkish	The labour market was regarded as one of the major sources of inflation pressures. 
dovish	The inflation outlook reconfirms a slowdown in both headline and core inflation in the forthcoming period.
dovish	The Board agreed that the overall balance of risks posed a slight downside risk to inflation. 
dovish	They also pointed to the symptoms of an economic weakening.
dovish	The most recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to enter and remain in negative territory over the short term, as a result of broadening the scope of the reduced VAT rate to all food items and public food services as of 1 June 2015, but also amid the narrowing of the negative output gap at a quicker pace and the rise in unit labour costs.
hawkish	Inflation had risen to levels not seen for several decades in a number of countries, which had been further aggravated by disruptions in supply across a growing range of markets, in addition to persistent rises in commodity and energy prices.
neutral	In their addresses, Board members first referred to recent inflation developments.
hawkish	Labour demand had remained strong, and therefore the unemployment rate had fallen further in the second quarter, accompanied by an increase in the number of employees.
neutral	In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the present meeting.
hawkish	The Monetary Council unanimously took a decision that launching a cycle of interest rate hikes was warranted to ensure price stability, avoid persistent inflationary risks, and anchor inflation expectations.
neutral	A majority of the board members assessed the risks to the forecast as being significant but not tilted in either direction overall.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board clearly agreed that the economy was moving essentially in line with the forecast from the fifth situation report. 
hawkish	With a general tightening of monetary policy conditions, the cycle of base rate hikes was a definite indication to economic agents, that monetary policy was committed to low inflation. 
dovish	While discussing inflation developments, it was stressed that both the annual CPI and core inflation remained at low levels, even though a rise in the CPI close to the target could be expected as early as in September 2010.
dovish	The increase in annual inflation rate has nevertheless been marginally lower than that projected in the most recent forecasting exercise, reflecting a relatively slower pass-through of the VAT hike to consumer prices, given the persistence of the negative output gap.
dovish	Lasting geopolitical tensions could lead to a decline in external demand, associated with a rise in the risk premium.
hawkish	In the opinion of the majority of Council members, a significant risk factor of inflation growth is the currently observed acceleration in wage growth in the corporate sector.
neutral	These decisions, along with the consistent implementation of commitments made by the Romanian authorities under the financing agreements with international institutions, will ensure the preservation of prospects of a sustainable resumption of disinflation and a robust recovery of the economy in the context of the nominal and real convergence process.
dovish	Industrial production had fallen in September compared to a year earlier.
hawkish	The rise had primarily been driven by the electricity price hike, as well as by fuel price developments and faster core inflation.
hawkish	Both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation in 2012 were higher than in the baseline scenario of the previous forecast.
neutral	The board members agreed that macroeconomic developments in the last quarter had essentially confirmed the predictions of the previous forecast, as the external inflation pressures and the decline in commodity prices were both gradually fading.
hawkish	The Monetary Council decided to begin gradually withdrawing the government securities purchase programme from 24 August while considering aspects of maintaining market stability.
neutral	It was said in the discussion that monetary policy should take into account not only the attainment of the inflation target in consumer prices, but also long-term financial stability.
neutral	In assessing the various interest rate policy options, the overwhelming majority of members agreed that under the current circumstances the Council should continue with its wait-and-see approach.
dovish	Statistical estimates point to a consolidation of the disinflation process which is projected to be reflected in a slowdown of the average annual inflation rate to 5.0 percent in the coming period.
neutral	In the context of the domestic and foreign risks discussed above, the prevailing opinion among the board members was that the central bank should be forward-looking and prudent.
hawkish	It was said several times that if domestic inflationary pressures were higher than forecasted, it would be appropriate to increase the two-week repo rate by more than the standard step of 0.25 percentage point.
neutral	Other potential impact channels on the Czech economy were also mentioned in the discussion of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the future course of the US economy and the Czech Republic?s main trading partner economies. 
hawkish	In their analysis, Board members pointed out the major role that supply-side factors continued to play in the configuration of the upward path of the forecasted annual inflation rate, especially over the short time horizon.
hawkish	Council members again drew attention to the fact that inflation was expected to be temporarily around 4 percent in the spring months due to base effects and the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products at the beginning of the year.
dovish	The majority of the board members also agreed that there was an increasing likelihood of commencing foreign exchange interventions in order to further ease monetary policy.
neutral	The Board discussed domestic economic developments and their effect on inflation.
hawkish	They observed that the annual inflation rate had continued to leap during the first two months of 2017 Q4, going up from 1.77 percent in September to 2.63 percent in October and to 3.23 percent in November, close to the upper bound of the variation band of the flat target and significantly above the forecast.
hawkish	They also emphasised that given the growing importance of global factors in determining domestic inflation developments, an important indicator of domestic inflationary pressure is the growth rate of services prices, which has been gradually rising since mid-2006 and which now significantly exceeds the growth rate of prices of consumer goods and services.
neutral	As a result, risks to the outlook for domestic inflation had become balanced again.
neutral	A majority of the board members agreed that inflation expectations were well anchored and that the rise in headline inflation due to the potential VAT change would be only temporary, as evidenced by previous experience.
neutral	The members essentially agreed that it continued to be difficult to assess the developments on the labour market.
neutral	The Board discussed the existing commitment that the CNB would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the start of 2017.
neutral	Some of the members argued, however, that there might be structural impacts linked with redistributions between the household and corporate sectors and between individual household income groups.
hawkish	It was noted that, in September, the annual increase in credit to the private sector had continued to accelerate both in nominal and real terms.
dovish	The Board stated that the domestic economy was currently exposed to an unusual combination of anti-inflationary shocks of a cost, exchange rate and demand nature. 
dovish	Global investor sentiment had deteriorated since the Council?s previous policy decision and the probability of tensions in financial markets had increased. 
neutral	At the same time, the deepening of the financial crisis on global markets has triggered uncertainties surrounding the world economic outlook and the implications on the Romanian economy.
hawkish	While referring to the labour market situation, it was pointed out that the number of the employed in the economy increased in 2010 Q2 and employment in the enterprise sector continued to rise gradually in Q3.
hawkish	Discussing the developments in Poland?s real economy, it was emphasised that the 2018 Q2 GDP data pointed to continued robust economic growth. 
dovish	When referring to consumption decline, some Council members pointed out that it was largely driven by worsening situation in the labour market, including low wage growth and intensified concerns about job loss amidst heightened unemployment.
hawkish	Members agreed that there had been a clear, albeit previously unexpected, improvement in perceptions of risks in the past month. 
hawkish	Wage dynamics stayed above productivity growth, emphasizing the risks of deteriorating external competitiveness and of labour cost-related inflationary pressures.
dovish	In response to the adverse economic effects arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the MNB had expanded significantly the central bank balance sheet in 2020, thereby supporting the recovery of economic growth as well.
hawkish	Other Council members, however, pointed to the rising inflation expectations in the United States.
dovish	It was repeatedly noted that the crisis in the US financial markets and the slowdown of the US economy could have an anti-inflationary effect.
dovish	The Board agreed that the Czech economy, which is highly open, would be hard hit by the slump in external demand.
neutral	In connection with the timing of the exit, the board members discussed the robustness of the current inflation trend.
dovish	In particular, the outlook for the euro area was deteriorating, interest rates were falling around the world, and prices of commodities, energy-producing materials and food were decreasing sharply.
dovish	The negative output gap might close at the end of the forecast horizon.
neutral	Inflation, which was being driven by one-off price deregulations and changes to tax rates, should therefore have very limited impacts on inflation expectations.
hawkish	As the increased value added tax will immediately trigger a significant rise of consumer price levels - and consequently a temporary pick-up in inflation - the NBR will act to limit the second-round effects of this measure and firmly anchor inflation expectations at low levels.
dovish	Some thought that the trend inflation measures, indicating a sustained fall in inflation, as well as better-than-expected readings of recent tradables inflation suggested that upside risks to inflation may have fallen since May.
neutral	The Board discussed the risks of the forecast.
hawkish	As for the cyclical position of the economy, Board members remarked that, in Q3, economic growth had witnessed the fourth successive faster-than-expected acceleration, which had also been the most significant one; the annual growth rate of GDP had climbed to 8.8 percent, from 6.1 percent in Q2, given that, contrary to forecasts, its quarterly rate had followed a more pronounced upward trend to a ten-year high. 
neutral	The members of the Council emphasised that the assessment of the NBP?s interest rates level consistent with ensuring price stability in the medium term would depend on the data to be released in the coming months.
dovish	Other members proposed that it should be cut by 25 basis points. 
neutral	The current setting of the monetary conditions was assessed as roughly neutral.
dovish	The NBR Board will continue to vigilantly monitor monetary and macroeconomic developments, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to ensure the maintenance of disinflation on the projected trajectory and consolidate European Union convergence, relying also on the support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix.
hawkish	It was observed that the slightly faster-than-expected increase had been triggered by supply-side factors, especially the significant, larger-than-anticipated hikes in fuel prices ? amid the rise in the oil price and in the exchange rate of the leu against the US dollar ? and in tobacco product prices.
dovish	Several members, however, argued that reducing interest rates in a sequence of small steps might better facilitate achievement of the Bank?s long-term monetary policy objectives.
neutral	Despite having slowed last year, the Czech economy remained close to its potential output level.
dovish	Some Council members emphasised that according to most forecasts inflation in those economies would remain at a relatively low level in the coming years, which would be conducive to lower inflation in the world economy.
hawkish	Year-on-year inflation was 6.67 percent in November 2007, remaining above the upper limit of the target band, due to a steep increase in food prices and in the tariffs of services indexed to the leu's exchange rate.
dovish	The economy was below its potential and was not emerging from the trough of the business cycle, and domestic demand was depressed.
dovish	A slump in production capacity utilisation would imply a need to adapt to the new market conditions in the Czech economy and abroad. 
neutral	After the presentation, the Board went on to discuss the newly available information and the risks of the January forecast.
neutral	The Monetary Council would continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial environment.
hawkish	Higher expectations regarding economic growth and interest rates in the euro area were presented as a moderate upside risk. 
neutral	While analysing inflation developments, the Council members pointed to further decline in CPI inflation which went down to 2.4% in December 2012, i.e. to the level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5%.
neutral	It was said repeatedly that in an economy where inflation had long been close to, or below, the inflation target, inflation expectations were well anchored.
neutral	Leaving monetary policy rates unchanged should be enough to enable monetary-policy relevant inflation to return into the lower half of the tolerance band around the inflation target at the forecast horizon.
neutral	Council members could not agree as to the impact of the April and June interest rate increases on the exchange rate of the zloty.
hawkish	Board members noted that the number of employees economy-wide had continued to increase at the relatively robust pace seen a quarter earlier, while the unemployment rate had fallen by another 0.2 percentage points to a new post-crisis low.
hawkish	Inflation would rise well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the 2% target in the quarters ahead. 
hawkish	In a discussion about the fiscal policy changes, the opinion was expressed that the implementation of the tax reform might further spur corporate and private investment. 
neutral	The external environment was marked by tensions and volatility, amid the adverse reaction of financial markets to the escalating sovereign debt crisis, the deepening of problems faced by the European banking system and the lingering uncertainties related to the world economic growth outlook. 
neutral	In February 2021, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 2.6 percent level reported in December 2020.
hawkish	There was also discussion of the observed growth in investment activity, especially in the machinery and equipment item, which is traditionally dominated by private investment.
dovish	The annual pace of economic growth witnessed a slowdown, owing primarily to the deceleration in domestic demand dynamics, largely attributable to the negative contribution of gross fixed capital formation.
neutral	In line with the new forecast, the Board also stated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. 
neutral	The Council set the discount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. 
dovish	In this respect, several members pointed out that the expected decline of corporate production and the deterioration of profitability should result in the gradual shrinking of the balance of payments deficit, which might mitigate external vulnerability.
dovish	Mortgage bond purchases would take place in the primary and the secondary markets. 
dovish	NBP will also offer bill discount credit intended to refinance corporate loans granted by banks.
neutral	The members of the Council also discussed the impact of the zloty exchange rate on inflation.
neutral	Members arguing for maintaining rates were of the view that as long as there was no clear-cut evidence of the perceived inflationary risks materialising, the Council should not alter its current ?wait-and-see? approach.
dovish	That had entailed a sudden worsening of the global financial market sentiment and the increase to extreme levels in the volatility of prices for all major asset classes.
hawkish	Several members took the view that there was a significant possibility that the cost shocks would be passed through into prices and, as a result, inflation would remain above the target in 2012.
hawkish	Yet, the majority of the Council members argued that a marked rise in inflation expectations combined with a strong growth in commodity prices in the global markets created, in a situation of continuing economic recovery, a risk of persisting heightened inflation. 
dovish	While discussing the investment activity of enterprises it was pointed out that corporate investment was being curtailed due to low production capacity utilization, relatively low demand growth and high uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth as well as about changes in public finances.
hawkish	Another factor suggesting a recovery of the global economy was quite high capacity utilisation in the area of commodities, whose prices might turn into a major inflationary factor again.
hawkish	Data illustrate a pick-up in private consumption and investment growth, bolstered by the recovery of lending in local currency, to households in particular, along with a sizeable advance in unit wage costs across the industrial sector.
