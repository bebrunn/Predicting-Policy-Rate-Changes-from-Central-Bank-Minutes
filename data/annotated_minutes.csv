dovish,"It was also said that current inflation was below the inflation target and the fact that it was measured using a new index was not relevant, as the new index had brought the consumer basket structure more into line with reality. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,According the new forecast a modest slowdown in economic growth and persisting low monetary policy inflation (i.e. consumer price inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of indirect taxes) could be expected. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Compared to the previous macroeconomic forecast from October last year, expected inflation and forecast-consistent interest rates had been revised downwards. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Opinions were also expressed that a future rate cut could not be ruled out, depending on how the situation develops. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Compared to the previous macroeconomic forecast from October last year, expected inflation and forecast-consistent interest rates had been revised downwards. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"On the other hand, however, it was said that the lower-than-expected inflation, even though resulting from a change in the basket structure, was a downside risk of the forecast, or a risk of non-fulfilment of the inflation target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In this context, it was also said that monetary policy, ceteris paribus, should react to lower inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"On the other hand, however, it was said that consumer credit growth was slowing.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,A role had been played by the new definition of the consumer basket and lower-than-expected inflation in a number of segments.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said that, aside from the impacts of the indirect tax increases, the planned reform of public finances would also probably generate a slowdown in demand-pull inflation impulses. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"A downside risk, by contrast, was August inflation, which at 2.4% in annual terms had come in 0.2 percentage point lower than forecasted, mainly due to adjusted inflation excluding fuels.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Against this, it was said that the reduction in the budget deficit would probably mean a fall in expenditure and hence a decrease in government consumption.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the context of the turmoil on the financial markets, the Board agreed that lower growth abroad and, as a result, weaker external demand could be expected by comparison with the forecast assumptions. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board discussed the current evolution of the exchange rate and agreed that its present level was strongly anti-inflationary compared to the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The forecast had responded to the changes in the global environment, in particular the significant fall in the one-year EURIBOR interest rate path resulting from the financial market turmoil, the uncertainty regarding its impact on real economic activity and the resulting monetary policy response.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In line with this, real GDP growth would slow from the 6.2% expected this year to 5% in 2008 and then speed up again to 5.6% in 2009.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"During a discussion of the aggregate demand situation the Board agreed that owing to the turbulence and heightened nervousness in the financial markets there was a risk of lower-than-expected growth abroad and, as a result, weaker external demand.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By contrast, the downside factors included a substantially stronger exchange rate, a slightly lower expected level of economic activity in the third quarter and an outlook of somewhat slower economic growth abroad.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The overall risks of the forecast were assessed as being slightly on the downside, with the principal upside and downside risks diverging to either side rather significantly.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Some of the board members expressed concerns about potential persistence of the adverse consequences of the mortgage crisis for the financial sector and about a possible future slowdown in euro area growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Attention was given to signals of a possible modest downturn in domestic economic activity in the third quarter of 2007.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Further dampening of inflationary pressures would be aided by a slowdown in economic growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The new forecast responded among other things to changes in the external environment, where the financial market turbulence was starting to adversely affect the economic growth of the major global economies.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The economic activity outlook for the euro area countries had been lowered.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Against this, it was argued that the previously mentioned slowdown in global economic activity, which might turn out to be far more significant than forecasted, might adversely affect the economic growth of the Czech Republic.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The possibility of significantly lower interest rates in the euro area was discussed in the context of the recent dramatic interest rate reduction in the USA. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The slowdown in global economic activity might also lead to some easing of the demand pressures on world prices of food and oil, which in the recent past had risen sharply and had thus contributed to the cost shock to Czech prices.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The newly available information suggested that the risks to inflation in relation to the February forecast were on both the upside and the downside, but had moved towards the downside overall.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By contrast, the lower-than-expected wage growth at the end of 2007 could be termed a downside risk in relation to the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The external environment and also the current settings of the monetary conditions were included among the downside risks.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The financial crisis in some segments of the international credit market could lead to a downswing in European economic growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The downside risks included an expected slowdown in external demand and appreciation of the koruna exchange rate.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was repeatedly noted that the crisis in the US financial markets and the slowdown of the US economy could have an anti-inflationary effect.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By 2009, the real economy was expected to turn anti-inflationary, as a result of a tight exchange rate component of the monetary conditions, restrictive fiscal policy and weaker external demand.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In addition, it was likely that the exchange rate shock would temporarily slow investment activity, and a dampening effect on the labour market could also be expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The prevailing view was that the anti-inflationary effect of the strong exchange rate would be significant, thanks mainly to effective competition in the tradable goods sector.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Slowing credit growth might therefore be expected. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,GDP growth would continue slowing in the coming quarters owing to the dampening effect of the very strong exchange rate and weak external demand on export growth and also as a result of slowing gross capital formation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The recent correction in the commodity markets was identified as a downside risk to inflation, as commodity prices might stabilise at lower levels than assumed by the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to lower the CNB two-week repo rate to 3.50%, effective 8 August 2004.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"At the same time it decided to lower the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 2.50% and 4.50% respectively.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was mentioned that this development might be linked with cooling economic growth and falling consumer confidence abroad.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"At 6.5%, inflation in August had been 0.3 percentage point lower than forecasted.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The exchange rate, which had, on average, appreciated more markedly than forecasted during the third quarter, was also acting in a slightly anti-inflationary directio",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board agreed that the overall balance of risks posed a slight downside risk to inflation. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board stated that the slowdown in economic growth owing to the worse external demand outlook could be more significant than forecasted.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was mentioned that the outlook for external demand was deteriorating significantly and the effects of the financial crisis would undoubtedly also appear in Europe.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The domestic economy was continuing to decline from the peak of the business cycle.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The board members agreed that the overall balance of risks to inflation was clearly on the downside and that the new information received since the previous monetary policy meeting and since the completion of the new forecast was tending towards a more significant reduction of interest rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In particular, the outlook for the euro area was deteriorating, interest rates were falling around the world, and prices of commodities, energy-producing materials and food were decreasing sharply.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The Board stated that the domestic economy was currently exposed to an unusual combination of anti-inflationary shocks of a cost, exchange rate and demand nature. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The downswing in economic activity abroad was gradually transmitting to the domestic economy as a result of the latter?s strong export orientation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to lower the CNB two-week repo rate.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Both the situation report and the assessment of the latest data implied a clear anti-inflationary balance of risks for the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board agreed that the external environment in particular was a source of sizeable anti-inflationary shocks.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,At the same time it decided to lower the discount rate and Lombard rate.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The domestic economy was continuing to decline from the peak of the business cycle.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"According to the new forecast, inflation would fall this year and would approach zero in mid-2009. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Consistent with the forecast was a decline in interest rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The board members agreed that the appropriate response to the current situation was to lower rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The Board agreed that the Czech economy, which is highly open, would be hard hit by the slump in external demand.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,A slump in production capacity utilisation would imply a need to adapt to the new market conditions in the Czech economy and abroad. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Considerable attention was also given to developments in the labour market, where the number of vacancies was continuing to fall and unemployment was on the rise. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Owing to the deepening global economic crisis, the economic situation had been less favourable in this period than assumed by the previous forecast. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"As regards inflation expectations, it was said that a decrease could be expected. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In response to the sharp economic downswing abroad, domestic GDP had fallen in 2009 Q1 by 0.9 percentage point more than forecasted. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly that a reduction in rates was consistent with the new forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said several times that the external forecasts predicting a relatively rapid rebound might be overly optimistic. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The rate of growth of potential output might also slow, so the lower economic growth would not necessarily have an anti-inflationary effect and consequently would not necessitate a monetary policy easing. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The Board stated that the fiscal measures would imply a restriction of demand, which would have an anti-inflationary effect.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Inflation had continued falling in 2009 Q3, fluctuating well below the lower boundary of the inflation-target tolerance band. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"On the one hand, it was argued that a reduction of interest rates was desirable since it would allow the interest rate differential to decrease.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The Board then discussed GDP, which had recorded a lower-than-forecasted year-on-year decline. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Headline inflation had risen in 2009 Q4, but had remained below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the inflation target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"According to the forecast, no domestic inflation pressures were currently visible.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The decline in employment had deepened further and unemployment had increased. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In year-on-year terms, GDP had continued falling, doing so faster than the forecast had assumed.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"However, some of the board members expressed the view that the aforementioned anti-inflationary risks were so significant that a downward movement of interest rates could be imagined if they were to materialise.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing view was that the overall macroeconomic environment was anti-inflationary and that the appropriate response would be to lower rates.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The prevailing view in the discussion was that there were anti-inflationary risks of lower economic growth abroad owing to the fiscal situation in certain indebted euro area countries. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By contrast, the indicators of the domestic real economy were generally anti-inflationary: annual GDP growth had been 0.7 percentage points lower than forecasted, the decline in total employment had increased, and wage growth had been lower than expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion of the lower-than-forecasted GDP growth and the structure of GDP formation, mention was made of the sharp decline in construction output.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that this reflected households? reluctance to spend combined with government austerity measures.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Fiscal policy could therefore foster lower economic growth and lower inflation next year. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The labour market was still being affected by the fading recession. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly that the current exchange rate and the demand effect of the planned fiscal consolidation were among the downside risks to inflation,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Lower inflation had been fostered by a stronger exchange rate and the impacts of the proposed fiscal consolidation. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Doubts were repeatedly expressed about whether the GDP growth forecast of 1.2% for 2011 was not too pessimistic. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In this regard, it was said that even though the uncertainty associated with expected GDP growth was high, there was spare capacity in the economy and the output gap was significantly negative.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The inflation pressures were therefore very subdued.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"GDP growth would temporarily slow to 1.6% in 2011 as a result of fiscal consolidation, a decline in some specific investments and investment in inventories, and slowing growth in external economic activity.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Monetary aggregate growth in the Czech Republic and in the euro area was currently subdued and not indicating any danger of inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The initial inflationary pressures stemming from the domestic economy were not significant at present, owing to weak domestic demand and low wage growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Economic growth would slow to 1.5% this year as a result of fiscal restriction, fading investment in inventories and slowing external economic activity.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The debt problems in some euro area countries were a downside risk.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The prevailing view was that domestic demand was subdued and that GDP growth would slow further this year.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Economic growth would be dampened by fiscal consolidation, slackening growth in external economic activity, fading investment in inventories and by the debt problems in the euro area and elsewhere. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Lower-than-expected growth abroad and an escalation of the debt problems of certain euro area countries were sources of increased uncertainty. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The risks of the forecast were tilted slightly towards lower inflation and significantly towards lower interest rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Annual GDP growth had been 2.2% in Q2, i.e. 0.3 percentage point lower than forecasted. Annual inflation had been 1.7% in August, i.e. 0.4 percentage point lower than forecasted.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Monetary-policy relevant inflation would be slightly below the inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Economic growth would slow in the remainder of 2011 and further in 2012, mainly in response to a contraction in external demand and owing to fiscal consolidation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish," The Board agreed that the risks and uncertainties were currently extremely high and that the majority of them would come from abroad, owing mainly to the escalation of the debt crisis in the euro area.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said several times that the situation in the euro area could be assessed as anti-inflationary owing to reduced outlooks for economic growth, inflation and the interest rate path.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said that the demand-pull inflation pressures in the domestic economy would be insignificant this year owing to the absence of GDP growth, fiscal consolidation and also lower household purchasing power because of the VAT increase.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The annual growth of the domestic economy ? driven solely by net exports ? had recorded a further noticeable slowdown in 2011 Q4.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By contrast, the slow growth of the domestic economy was dampening inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Domestic economic activity was also anti-inflationary by comparison with the baseline scenario, as GDP had fallen by 0.7 percentage point year on year in 2012 Q1 whereas the forecast had predicted stagnation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Practically all components of GDP had been lower than forecasted.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the consensus was that the demand pressures from the domestic economy were currently very subdued and would remain anti-inflationary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The prevailing view was that the economy did not currently have room for higher wage growth given the pessimism of domestic economic agents about the future economic situation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Monetary-policy relevant inflation would decline below the target at the end of this year and would remain below it until the end of the forecast horizon. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"However, it was also said that a timely interest rate cut was the appropriate monetary policy response.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board discussed the causes of the worse growth outlook for the Czech economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said repeatedly that relatively pessimistic private sector expectations were a major factor, in addition to the negative growth outlook for the euro area and the impacts of fiscal consolidation, and that this pessimism was not necessarily in line with Czech economic fundamentals.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that domestic economic activity was subdued and therefore anti-inflationary.omestic economic activity was subdued and therefore anti-inflationary. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In this context, it was mentioned that a rise in household savings accompanied by falling consumption represented a downside risk to inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board discussed in detail the role of the exchange rate of the koruna as an anti-inflationary factor.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Most of the board members agreed that the appropriate monetary policy response was to lower rates to technical zero and keep them at this level over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increased significantly.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly that inflation would be in the lower part of the tolerance band for the foreseeable future and that a decline in rates was consistent with this outlook.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that new GDP figures confirmed that the economy was in recession.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly that the anti-inflationary domestic economy was affecting the labour market.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said in the discussion that GDP growth was lagging behind the fundamentals of the Czech economy and that the weaker growth was due to low sentiment among households and corporations stemming from uncertainty at home and abroad.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Europe was described as being in a period of sustained low growth and burdened by numerous economic problems. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The decline in real GDP had deepened to -1.7% in Q4, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage point more than had been forecasted. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that the decline in net exports was also hardly a signal of sustained domestic economic recovery. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board discussed the causes of the lower-than-forecasted household consumption growth in detail.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that the spreading debt problems in the south of the euro area had undermined confidence within the external financial sector and that the lower sentiment was spreading to the external and domestic real economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that anti-inflationary factors had accumulated since the previous situation report and that no significant upside risks to inflation were apparent over the entire forecast horizon. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,This deviation had been due to lower gross capital formation as a result of a deeper decline in inventories. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that risks towards a need for easier monetary conditions had already been identified when the forecast was being discussed six weeks earlier and that the new data were strengthening this need. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The majority of the board members also agreed that there was an increasing likelihood of commencing foreign exchange interventions in order to further ease monetary policy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board also agreed that the appropriate response was to leave rates unchanged and to maintain them at technical zero over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The economy was below its potential and was not emerging from the trough of the business cycle, and domestic demand was depressed.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB?s commitment to intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the exchange rate so as to keep the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro close to CZK 27/EUR.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The domestic economy thus remained anti-inflationary in a context of very low nominal wage growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The risks to the current inflation forecast were on the downside mainly because of an unexpectedly large year-on-year decline in nominal wages in the business sector in 2013 Q4.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly in this regard that the undershooting of the inflation target and the further accumulation of anti-inflationary risks in the domestic economy reflected insufficient monetary easing in past quarters.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The deflationary tendencies on the labour market were also posited as a possible explanation of the observed decline in wages in 2013 Q4.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said that in the euro area disinflationary pressures were still evident in consumer and producer prices, which were causing lower domestic inflation via slower growth in import prices.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said several times that inflation in the euro area was significantly below expectations, the price index outlooks were being revised downwards and there was no sign of any change that might have a further negative effect on domestic inflation in the future. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"However, the opinion was also expressed that production capacity was not yet fully utilised and the domestic economy was ceasing to be anti-inflationary rather than having a stronger inflationary effect. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The low inflation had been due to a continuing decline in administered prices and subdued inflation in the euro area. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was also said that economic growth was not creating sufficient inflationary pressures as yet and that, on the contrary, disinflationary pressures from abroad were prevailing. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation had decreased in Q4, remaining well below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"As expected, annual growth of the Czech economy had slowed to 1.5% in 2014 Q4.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The environment was currently one of low inflation, as evidenced in particular by low wage growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said that it was appropriate to continue with the easy monetary policy as currently configured.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Import prices were depressing inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was said several times that although the need for easy monetary conditions had decreased since the previous meeting, it remained high, as evidenced by the only slow return of inflation to the inflation target from below over the monetary policy horizon.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The deviation from the forecast had been due predominantly to a renewed decline in food prices, reflecting a drop in prices of food and agricultural commodities. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The main causes of the fall in inflation had been a slowdown in annual food price inflation and an acceleration of the decline in fuel prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,There was a consensus that it was appropriate to leave monetary policy rates at technical zero and that a need to maintain significantly easy monetary conditions persisted. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was said repeatedly that the drop in oil prices was a positive supply shock.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Prices of food and fuels had declined as a result of persisting anti-inflationary supply shocks from abroad,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,This would be due mainly to a fall in government investment as a result of an only gradual start to the drawdown of EU funds in the new programme period.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the new forecast as being slightly anti-inflationary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,There was a consensus that the balance of risks to the current forecast was slightly anti-inflationary at the monetary policy horizon. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,It was also said that in the short term the increased uncertainty would lead to a downturn in investment activity. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,A number of the board members nevertheless expressed doubts about the resumption of investment growth in 2016 H2 assumed in the forecast. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It was mentioned repeatedly that, unlike headline inflation, adjusted inflation excluding fuels as an indicator of domestic demand-pull inflation pressures was still below the inflation target. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Likewise, the currently very subdued government investment would revert to growth this year.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"By contrast, the construction industry was still in decline as a result of a continued fall in infrastructure investment.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The inflation pressures would ease in the period ahead owing to rising labour productivity growth and a renewed anti-inflationary effect of import prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In the area of government investment, by contrast, the opinions were generally sceptical, partly due to slower drawdown of European funds.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Risks in this direction stemmed mainly from inflation, which had decreased faster at the start of this year than the CNB had expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"According to the new forecast, inflation would stay slightly below the target this year.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"It had been lower than forecasted, mainly as a result of a one-off shock to food price growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The Board also discussed the observed cooling of international trade, which was fuelling concerns of a potential stronger global growth slowdown.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Nevertheless, the overall inflation pressures in the domestic economy were easing somewhat, due mainly to a decline in import prices.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,The growth of the Czech economy would slow in the quarters ahead due to weak growth in external demand and would return close to its potential rate at the end of next year.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,Another issue discussed was the observed slowdown in domestic private investment growth linked with the slackening of economic growth abroad and its effect on domestic inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"According to a majority of its members, numerous indicators ? among them household consumption, employment, the average wage and the total volume of wages and salaries ? were rising rather more slowly than forecasted.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The aim of the meeting was to adopt, in a timely and flexible manner, stabilising monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on price and financial stability and on the Czech economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Based on the available information, the Czech economy could be expected to slow sharply or even contract this year.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The strong domestic inflation pressures, which had been amplified by one-off factors at the start of the year, would fade quickly.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"There was also an in-depth discussion of the exchange rate, which had depreciated significantly as a result of the substantially worse economic outlook and financial market panic.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In addition, the Board declared it was ready to cut interest rates further should the economic situation so require.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,A majority of the board members felt that the risks to future inflation were tilted to the downside compared with the baseline scenario of the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"The board members agreed that a worse course of the pandemic, longer lockdowns at home and abroad and an ensuing deterioration in the financial situation and sentiment of businesses and households were the main risk to the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,This could lead to a lengthier cyclical downturn of the Czech economy and hence to a need to keep monetary conditions accommodative for longer than assumed in the baseline scenario of the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"In addition to high prices of commodities and energy, these pressures reflected persisting problems in global production chains.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was stated in the discussion that this was consistent with the persisting attractiveness of the Czech economy and the still sufficient room for foreign direct investment inflow.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The argument was also made that the appreciation of the Czech currency against the euro was linked with developments in the region and that the decision-making of large financial investors was not based solely on the interest rate differential. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"There was a consensus that the upside risks to inflation also included the robust economic growth in neighbouring countries, as the latest indicators from these countries were even better than originally assumed in the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The opinion was also expressed, however, that the risks to inflation were skewed slightly to the upside overall.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The nominal exchange rate was identified as an upside risk to inflation. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Another upside risk to inflation mentioned was expected developments abroad, where the primary upside factors included a rise in interest rates in the euro area, leading to a widening of the negative interest rate differential, and also an increase in expected economic growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,In the context of the assessment of external developments it was said that the higher economic growth combined with the lower expected inflation perhaps suggested growth in potential output without the need to tighten monetary policy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The accelerating money supply growth was also identified as a potential medium-term upside risk to inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Higher expectations regarding economic growth and interest rates in the euro area were presented as a moderate upside risk. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The rising share of household consumption in GDP was mentioned as a moderate upside risk.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Opinions were expressed that a more optimistic outlook for euro area growth and expectations of further ECB interest rate increases - together with their implications for domestic exchange rate developments - were moderate upside risks. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that the decline in unemployment and some indications from the corporate sector suggested that the labour market would not be able to accommodate further economic growth easily.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Workforce shortages could therefore increase pressures on inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,According the forecast the Czech economy had been fluctuating above the non-accelerating inflation level of output for six quarters.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The growth structure had changed, with consumption and investment now being the engines of economic growth. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said that the external environment - for instance the increase in the euro area growth estimate, but also the latest data on higher oil prices than expected in the forecast - could become an inflationary factor. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Board agreed that the growth of the Czech economy would remain robust.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was also said that utilisation of production capacities was higher than in past years.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said several times that unemployment was coming down fairly rapidly and that this might signal the onset of wage inflation pressures. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Four members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,These risks were assessed in the situation report as being on the upside overall. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Annual consumer price inflation had risen to 2.5% in April and was thus 0.4 percentage points higher than forecasted. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Figures from the real economy suggested a risk of higher-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter of 2007.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,There was a discussion about whether the upside risks of the forecast associated with the evolution of the domestic economy were already starting to materialise.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The higher-than-forecasted rise in the consumer price index might thus have been due to a combination of several factors that were not linked with monetary policy, such as shifts in the seasonality of food prices, shifts in the timing of the impacts of the increase in indirect taxes and the of the rise in regulated prices, etc.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The relatively sharp fall in the general unemployment rate compared to the forecast was identified as an upside factor, as it might lead to higher wage growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the light of the effects on economic growth and inflation in the Czech Republic, the Board also discussed the pick-up in economic growth in the euro area and the related revision of the external growth prospects. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"At the close of the meeting the Board decided to increase the CNB two-week repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 %, effective 1 June 2007.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"At the same time it decided to increase the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 1.75 % and 3.75 % respectively. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The underlying domestic factors included new information from the labour market, including faster wage growth, along with an upswing in economic growth and higher-than-forecasted inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Expected external economic growth had picked up pace and expected interest rates in the euro area had risen. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The majority of the members agreed that the balance of risks was tilted towards the upside.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish, The prevailing view in the discussion was that the newly observed growth in nominal unit wage costs in industry was indicating wage-cost pressures.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was also said, however, that temporarily increased nominal unit wage costs can also be a sign that businesses are gearing up for a further strengthening of demand, and the opinion was expressed that faster-growing wages can be natural for a converging economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In a debate on the newly published GDP figures it was said that the rapid economic growth was continuing, and the view was presented that a further increase in domestic demand growth could be expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The opinion was expressed that rapid economic growth should not be a reason for tightening monetary policy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Another of the upside factors debated was the observed higher agricultural producer price inflation. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Given the upside balance of risks to inflation, the Board discussed the possibility of raising interest rates. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The appropriate response should therefore be to raise rates already at the present meeting.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The existence of a positive output gap and a further gradual widening of that gap this year, along with expectations regarding external economic developments and the effect of fiscal policy, had led to the economic growth forecast being increased above 6% for 2007. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In 2007, therefore, the economy would grow at a faster pace than the expected rate of growth of potential output.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The inflationary signals from the domestic and external economies had pushed the inflation forecast upwards compared to April.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the discussion of the starting points of the forecast, it was said that the economy was going through a phase of dynamic economic growth, which, unlike in the past, was being accompanied by an economic upswing abroad.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said that information from the labour market was confirming the forecast of strong domestic demand growth, and the observed growth of the money supply was also mentioned as an upside factor.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In this discussion, the opinion was expressed that stronger monetary policy responses would be appropriate primarily in the event of economic shocks. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"At the same time it decided to increase the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 2.0% and 4.0% respectively.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This would affect inflation primarily by increasing the contribution of growth in indirect taxes.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks of the July forecast, which predicted a further rise in interest rates.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Against this, however, the prevailing view was that the new labour market data confirmed the forecast assumptions of an upswing in wage growth and nominal unit wage cost growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to the situation report, the changes to VAT, the rise in excise duties and the changes to regulated prices would all be more inflationary than forecasted. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In a discussion about the fiscal policy changes, the opinion was expressed that the implementation of the tax reform might further spur corporate and private investment. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Regarding the influence of the potential slowdown abroad on the Czech economy, it was emphasised that unlike in the past the domestic growth was based to a large extent on domestic demand, so any negative external shock could be comfortably accommodated. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The economy would continue to go through a phase of buoyant economic growth driven by growth in household consumption and investment.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said repeatedly that the combination of rising indirect tax rates, regulated rents, energy prices and food prices would affect headline inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"At 4% in October, annual consumer price inflation had been 0.2 percentage points higher than predicted by the October forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This deviation had been due to higher-than-expected growth in food prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"At the same time, GDP growth figures for the second quarter had been revised upwards. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Some of the board members stressed the upside risks to inflation, pointing out that a further pick-up in inflation owing to the increases in VAT and regulated prices might affect hitherto well-anchored inflation expectations, which would result in stronger second-round impacts on inflation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The starting conditions of the forecast assumed comparatively strong demand-pull inflation pressures from the real economy, stemming primarily from the positive output gap. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The new forecast had also taken into account the higher-than-expected rise in inflation in late 2007, which it assessed as a one-off shock linked mainly with external developments.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Most of the newly available data on the domestic economy were assessed as representing upside risks to inflation,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The upside risks included the possibility of the current higher-than-expected inflation feeding through into inflation expectations and subsequently into inflation. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said during the discussion that it was not appropriate to play a waiting game with the response to the upside risks to inflation and that, at a time of increased uncertainty regarding external developments, monetary policy should be focused on domestic inflation factors, which were associated with less uncertainty. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The real economy was at the peak of the business cycle and its current effect was assessed as inflationary.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,One argument in favour of continued robust economic growth was the still high level of consumer confidence.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"On average, the Board inclined towards the view that the risks of the baseline scenario were broadly on the upside with regard to inflation, although some members assessed the risks as being balanced.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the subsequent debate about inflation expectations, it was said that a period of high inflation and of waiting for an appreciation to materialise can lead to volatility of inflation expectations.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Despite slowing slightly in the second quarter of 2008, consumer price inflation had remained well above the inflation-target tolerance band. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Wage growth, which might be higher than forecasted, was identified as an upside risk to inflation.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The comparatively high growth in the money supply, driven mainly by growth in currency in circulation, was also mentioned as a partial upside inflation factor.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The opinion was expressed that some improvement had occurred since the autumn, when the markets had been frozen. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The opinion was also expressed that given low interest rates, demand for loans might rise significantly once the recession subsides, causing inflation to go up.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,A slower-than-expected wage decline in industry and construction was mentioned as a risk of higher inflation in the future. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The fairly strong consumption persistence of Czech households, which was slowing the decline in aggregate demand, was identified as a factor supporting moderate optimism. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Another factor suggesting a recovery of the global economy was quite high capacity utilisation in the area of commodities, whose prices might turn into a major inflationary factor again.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that year-on-year average nominal wage growth in the business sector was surprisingly high given the low economic activity. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The currently weaker exchange rate was identified as an upside risk to inflation by some of the board members.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The deviation of inflation by 0.3 percentage points from the forecast had been caused by higher-than-expected growth in fuel prices and regulated prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Net inflation was steadily rebounding from its previous low values. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The upside risks of the new forecast included potentially faster growth in commodity and food prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that this recovery might speed up the recovery in Czech exports and growth in European consumer prices and foreign interest rates relative to the new forecast. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The inflationary factors had included published data on higher household consumption and slightly faster wage growth, a higher outlook for food price inflation and a higher outlook for regulated price inflation due to an expected increase in electricity prices.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"However, it was also said that upside risks to inflation were emerging as a result of the continuing domestic and external economic recovery.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said repeatedly that the current level of monetary policy rates was low and could present a risk in the longer term from the financial stability perspective. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Some agricultural commodity prices and import prices in some sectors were rising.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Some of the board members expressed the opinion that the unexpectedly higher growth in household consumption could represent an upside risk to inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Rising world commodity prices and a weaker exchange rate might pose an upside risk to inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"On the other hand, it was repeatedly said that rates should be increased because the cost-pull inflation pressures could be sustained and because demand-pull inflation pressures might arise as a result of a faster household consumption recovery and a faster export recovery than assumed by the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that a very slight rise in demand pressures generated by wage growth could be expected at the forecast horizon.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"With regard to the future path of interest rates, the risks were heading upwards.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The opinion was expressed that the current evolution of the domestic economy was an upside risk to inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"However, it was said in the discussion that domestic economic growth would be higher than forecasted, especially this year, and that other sectors besides the export-oriented manufacturing industry were recovering thanks to the higher external growth. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said several times that only the first signs of recovery were being observed and that these signs could be slightly stronger in the outturns of some indicators than had been forecasted.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation in 2012 were higher than in the baseline scenario of the previous forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Board discussed the causes of the current higher inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"However, mention was made in the discussion of the good condition of the German economy, which was benefiting from exports to non-European markets.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The possibility of an increase in inflation expectations, a slightly weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the euro and higher commodity prices (especially oil prices) were identified as upside risks to inflation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The main inflationary factors were depreciation of the koruna and higher-than-expected average wage growth, reflected in higher nominal unit labour costs.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"By contrast, inventories and government consumption had been more favourable than expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said that rising employment amid a falling number of full-time equivalent employees meant an increasing number of part-timers, which was a favourable factor.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This deviation from the prediction had been due mainly to significantly better than expected net exports on the back of recovering external demand. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"As regards the assessment of domestic economy activity, the Board agreed that the figures from the domestic economy were signalling the start of an economic rebound.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"With regard to the economic recovery, mention was made of improving leading indicators such as growth in industrial orders and consumer confidence indicators, in respect of which households? persisting concerns about rising prices were emphasised.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In line with the forecast, economic activity had recovered in 2013 Q4 and even recorded a noticeably stronger rate of growth. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In quarter-on-quarter terms, economic activity had risen for the third consecutive quarter.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Economic growth would be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the exchange rate of the koruna and, to a lesser extent, also fiscal policy. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that the recovery was confirmed by continuing retail sales growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Economic growth would be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the weakened exchange rate and exceptionally low interest rates, and higher government investment. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,There was a consensus that the observed recovery in domestic economic activity was robust and gaining pace.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,All components of demand except net exports had contributed to the year-on-year increase in GDP. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"On the labour market, the number of vacancies was rising and the general unemployment rate was falling at a steady, albeit gradual, pace.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Indicators from the real economy at the start of 2014 Q3 were pointing to continued buoyant economic growth. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that the rapid rise in wages and the forecast for further wage growth were signalling the emergence of the first inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The forecast expected inflation to continue rising gradually and exceed the 2% target at the start of 2016.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Economic growth would be fostered by higher external demand, easy domestic monetary conditions and a recovery in government investment.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The domestic economy was on a growth path.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Employment and the share of unemployed persons were both doing better than forecasted.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said that domestic demand had rebounded and was showing robust growth, as evidenced by developments in the individual components of GDP, the employment and unemployment figures, a halt in growth in the saving rate, increasing credit growth and positive core inflation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This represented a positive signal that the domestic economy was generating inflation pressures. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,A majority of the board members agreed that economic growth would continue to be robust over the forecast horizon.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Higher adjusted inflation excluding fuels had also contributed to the pick-up in consumer price inflation, reflecting accelerating growth of the domestic economy, an improving labour market and a weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the dollar.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to the available data, the annual growth of the domestic economy had accelerated sharply to 4.2% in 2015 Q1, more than double the forecasted rate of growth.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The board members also positively assessed the fact that the growth was being driven by practically all components of demand. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The opinion was expressed that the relatively strong growth in the number of job vacancies was signalling a structural imbalance between labour supply and demand, which in the future might give rise to a shortage of labour in some parts of the market and would foster higher wage growth. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The growing domestic economy was fostering higher inflation,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In a discussion about domestic economic developments, there was a consensus that the growth of the domestic economy could be regarded as robust and sustainable.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,There was a consensus that economic growth was sustainable.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was also said that industry was facing increasing problems with staff shortages and that the wage cost-to-output ratio was rising.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was mentioned several times that fiscal policy might be more relaxed in future years than assumed by the forecast and that this would imply an increase in domestic demand pressures.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The slightly positive inflation had been due to the return of administered prices to annual growth and to still markedly positive adjusted inflation excluding fuels. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to the forecast, inflation would start rising in the near future, driven by increasing domestic economic activity and wages. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to the new forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, would thus occur in mid-2017. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said repeatedly that industrial production in the Czech Republic and in its main trading partner countries was rising, as were new orders and loans to non-financial corporations.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that the positive condition of the economy was also indicated by better-than-expected performance of the revenue side of the state budget.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish, Renewed growth in investment would foster higher economic growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The growing economic activity would be reflected in an increase in wage growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"This had been due to a stronger recovery in adjusted inflation excluding fuels, caused mainly by faster growth in prices of non-tradable goods.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"A growing contribution of prices in food services, driven, among other things, by the introduction of electronic sales registration, had been significant, as had faster growth in imputed rent due to rising prices of new properties, whose weight in the consumer price index had increased since the start of 2017.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Continued strong growth in labour demand had led to an upswing in employment growth and a further fall in the unemployment rate, neither of which the forecast had expected. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast for the rest of this year as being inflationary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Mention was also made of risks stemming from developments in the euro area, where a relatively strong economic recovery ? confirmed by leading indicators ? was expected.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Leading and coincidence indicators from the domestic economy remained favourable, especially as regards industrial production, retail sales and lending to the private sector.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Economic sentiment was favourable as well.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Inflation had risen further in 2017 Q1, entering the upper half of the tolerance band around the CNB?s target. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the new inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly inflationary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said that both the current data and the forecast were indicating that inflation was sustainable with respect to future fulfilment of the target thanks in part to favourable labour market developments in the form of rising employment and upward pressure on wages.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish," Nonetheless, GDP growth, which had jumped to 3% in year-on-year terms, had been higher than forecasted. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"On the one hand, mention was made of the positive evolution of economic activity in the euro area, whose rate of growth had been rising in recent quarters.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The board members also agreed that the future increase in interest rates would help mitigate the risks associated with growth in mortgage loans, to which the CNB had already reacted primarily with macroprudential instruments.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Robust growth in household consumption was continuing, in conditions of accelerating wage and employment growth and persisting consumer optimism.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The appreciation of the koruna had led to a tightening of the exchange rate component of the monetary conditions equivalent to an interest rate increase of 3/4 to 1 percentage point, but on the basis of the forecast the interest rate component of the monetary conditions could also be tightened somewhat.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was said several times that financial stability-related macroprudential considerations also spoke in favour of raising rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The size and timing of the interest rate increase was discussed. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish," A majority of the board members felt that there was no need to fear such a reaction, as most of the market was expecting a rate hike.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Czech economy was slightly above its potential output level.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to increase the two-week repo rate.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Lombard rate was increased.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Annual GDP growth had accelerated significantly further to 4.7% in 2017 Q2 and was distinctly above the forecast. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The increase in economic activity had been fostered not only by household consumption, reflecting buoyant growth in wages and employment, but also by a marked recovery in investment activity and by foreign trade, driven by rising external demand.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was also said that the rapid wage growth constituted a positive contribution to financial stability, because it was increasing households? ability to repay their loans. The high GDP growth rate was likewise debated.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Attention was also focused on the high growth in fixed investment, which had come as the biggest surprise compared with the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said repeatedly that the higher wage growth, disposable income and consumption were generating appropriate inflation pressures.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"It was said several times that if domestic inflationary pressures were higher than forecasted, it would be appropriate to increase the two-week repo rate by more than the standard step of 0.25 percentage point.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,It was therefore more appropriate to raise interest rates gradually from the financial stability point of view as well.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"There was also discussion of the observed growth in investment activity, especially in the machinery and equipment item, which is traditionally dominated by private investment.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Going forward, this could be reflected in higher productivity and competitiveness.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Czech economy was above its potential output level amid accelerating economic growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Growth in economic activity was also being significantly aided by an increase in investment in the private sector. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The overall inflation pressures remained strong, mainly reflecting accelerating wage growth amid robust growth of the domestic economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The Board agreed that the situation as regards inflation, the labour market, the phase of the business cycle and other macroeconomic parameters fully justified raising interest rates.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"As regards domestic price developments, there was a consensus that the economy was facing inflation pressures stemming from the positive output gap and the tight labour market.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This was because the economy had been operating above its potential output level for some time and would continue to do so according to the outlook.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The exchange rate of the koruna, which was weaker than forecasted, was repeatedly mentioned as the most significant inflationary factor.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The growth in household consumption was generating stable inflation pressures.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The overall fundamental inflation pressures remained strong and would rise even further in the short run, owing mainly to buoyant wage growth. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The prevailing view among the board members was that given the environment of solid economic growth, rapid wage growth, a weaker koruna and inflation in the upper half of the tolerance band, it was appropriate to tighten monetary policy further via interest rates. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Part of the discussion was devoted to the overheating of the domestic economy. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"However, the Czech economy was still operating above its potential, while the positive output gap was gradually closing.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The Board said that the risk of deflation and the related likelihood of using unconventional monetary policy instruments had decreased and that the next monetary policy action would most likely be an interest rate hike.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Economic activity might hence be in better shape in reality than indicated by the standard macroeconomic data.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"The Board also discussed the domestic inflation forecast, which saw inflation rising towards the upper boundary of the tolerance band in the next few quarters.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In the discussion about interest rates, a majority of the board members agreed that the monetary policy tightening decision had moved much closer since the last meeting.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In his opinion, this was leading many people to invest in property in fear of the expected high inflation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to some indicators, inflation expectations had started to creep up. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Inflation would rise well above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the 2% target in the quarters ahead. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"Greater or lengthier overloading of global supply chains, which could result in even stronger growth in producer prices, was an inflationary risk to the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Vojtech Benda said that the economy had moved appreciably in the inflationary direction since the last meeting.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to Tom? Nidetzk? and Tom? Holub, the labour market was also generating robust inflation pressures.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,A majority of the board members assessed the risks and uncertainties of the summer forecast as being markedly inflationary and hence requiring a faster rise in interest rates compared with the current forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Real interest rates would remain significantly negative even so.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,This was in response to the current exceptionally strong inflation pressures in the domestic and foreign economies.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,There was a consensus that global cost pressures were a significant source of the domestic price growth. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"In addition to high prices of commodities and energy, these pressures reflected persisting problems in global production chains. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,"According to a majority of the board members, there was a significant risk of them becoming unanchored from the inflation target in the present situation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,The labour market was regarded as one of the major sources of inflation pressures. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
hawkish,Developments in the euro area were acting in the inflationary direction via the expected path of one-year Euribor rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The larger banks were now tending to lend more, but the credit volumes issued via smaller banks were still falling.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the end of its extraordinary meeting, the Board decided to end the CNB?s exchange rate commitment. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The turmoil on global financial markets and the approval of the fiscal reform were identified as events raising the uncertainty of the decision-making process above its usual level.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed that the change in the shape of the yield curve might also reflect a revision of the economic growth outlook.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Some of the board members emphasised the fact that the rapid appreciation of the koruna in July had returned with renewed vigour in November.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Other potential impact channels on the Czech economy were also mentioned in the discussion of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the future course of the US economy and the Czech Republic?s main trading partner economies. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that the external economy was a source of even greater uncertainty than the domestic economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The board members agreed that there were many mutually conflicting tendencies in both the domestic and external economy and that this implied an unusually high degree of uncertainty for the decision-making process.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The outlook for external developments was uncertain owing to the deepening global financial market crisis.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that monetary policy decision-making was encumbered with greater uncertainty owing to the debt problems in certain countries.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said repeatedly that uncertainty had increased sharply in several areas in recent weeks.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"On the other hand, uncertainties regarding US trade policy, Brexit and the banking sector situation in some euro area countries were mentioned.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,They were being balanced by the strengthening exchange rate and continued subdued growth in foreign prices.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The board members agreed that the Chinese coronavirus epidemic was a completely new external uncertainty, but their views of this uncertainty differed in intensity.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Jir Rusnok said that the persisting external uncertainties (deglobalisation, trade wars, Brexit and the shift towards green energy), which had escalated further with the ongoing pandemic, had now been joined by domestic uncertainties. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the January situation report containing the new forecast for inflation and other macroeconomic indicators.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Economic growth was forecasted at approximately 5.3% in 2007 and 4.8% in 2008,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The overall inflation pressures from the real economy were thus now described in a more structured way by means of the real marginal cost gap, consisting of the real wage gap and a redefined output gap.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the new forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that there were risks on both the upside and downside.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The opinion was expressed that it should not, as the asset price growth may be just a consequence of rapidly rising wealth coupled with limited investment opportunities.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After discussing the situation report, the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.50%.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The meeting began with a presentation of the February situation report summarising the newly available economic data and the associated risks of the January forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The majority of the board members agreed on the overall assessment of the January forecast risks as being balanced. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Economic growth had been in line with the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After the presentation, the Board went on to discuss the newly available information and the risks of the January forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that the forecast risks were balanced and there were no strong arguments for either a rise or a cut in interest rates.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board then turned to a discussion of upside and downside risks to inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Opinions were also expressed that increases in indirect taxes would not have to affect consumer prices to the full extent. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In this context, the board members drew attention to the experience of other countries, for example Germany, as well as the past experience of the Czech Republic with incomplete pass-through of cost shocks into inflation. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The meeting opened with a presentation of the April situation report and the new forecast for inflation and economic developments.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Wages had ceased to be anti-inflationary.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The monetary conditions were broadly neutral overall.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After the presentation of the April situation report, the Board discussed the new forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"However, it was also said repeatedly that the economic developments in 2007 Q1, which had seen atypical weather conditions, did not necessarily have sufficient information content to distinguish between short-term fluctuations and trends, hence it was too early to talk of a build-up of inflationary factors.",Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,The presentation of the new macroeconomic forecast was followed by a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said that in an economy where inflation had long been close to the inflation target, inflation expectations were well anchored. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The members agreed that the aforementioned turbulence in global financial markets was not yet significant for the Czech economy and the monetary policy settings. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Some of the members argued, however, that there might be structural impacts linked with redistributions between the household and corporate sectors and between individual household income groups.",Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,"At the close of the meeting, the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 3.25%.",Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,"The G3 model is much more detailed, allowing for a more realistic description of the impacts of various economic shocks.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said repeatedly that in an economy where inflation had long been close to, or below, the inflation target, inflation expectations were well anchored.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Inflation, which was being driven by one-off price deregulations and changes to tax rates, should therefore have very limited impacts on inflation expectations.",Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,"Given their substantial share in the current rise in inflation, food prices were an important subject of debate.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The real monetary conditions index was slightly easy in its interest rate component and tight in its exchange rate component. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The Board agreed that the uncertainties associated with monetary policy decision-making were this time greater than usual, while the risks were heading in both directions.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The Board agreed that monetary policy decision-making was difficult, because both upside and downside risks to inflation in relation to the February forecast could be identified.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the first three quarters of 2009, headline inflation was expected to be in the lower half of the inflation-target tolerance band.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said repeatedly that the inflation pressures in the wage area were not particularly significant at present.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The current high inflation, however, was still assessed as being a transitory phenomenon.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the forecast horizon inflation would be falling towards the inflation target after the unwinding of the effect of the tax and price shocks that occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, thanks to the anti-inflationary effect of the current appreciation of the koruna and a gradual decline in inflation pressures from the domestic economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,In connection with expected future inflation developments it was said that inflation would gradually return to the current inflation target of 3%.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed that rates should remain unchanged in view of the new inflation target.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was also said that it was unclear whether wages would act in the inflationary or anti-inflationary direction.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In late 2009 and early 2010, inflation would then be at the 2% inflation target valid from 2010.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The opinion was expressed in the discussion that a sharper reduction in monetary policy rates was not necessarily the optimal response, as it would not necessarily influence effectively the situation in the interbank market and might also send out the wrong signal regarding the soundness of the Czech financial sector and the prospects for the domestic economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the current financial market situation in depth. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Conversely, the arguments for a more cautious approach included concerns of triggering a precipitous weakening of the exchange rate as a possible consequence of a too-large change in domestic rates.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the new forecast and the risks associated with it. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,The Board discussed the effectiveness of transmission from monetary policy rates to the real economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the context of the debate of monetary policy transmission mechanisms, it was said that a change in monetary policy rates might also act via the exchange rate channel and that the exchange rate affects the economy more quickly than interest rates.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Some of the board members argued that this uncertainty was acting in both directions. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The next subject of debate was the financial condition of corporations.,Czech National Bank,Czechia

neutral,"In the debate about inflation and its components, it was said that inflation was developing in line with the forecast. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The monetary policy priority was to hit the inflation target at the forecast horizon, and that was not currently in any danger. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said in the discussion that the lower-than-forecasted growth in food prices posed no significant downside risk to inflation, because food prices were low and the transmission of agricultural producer prices to food prices was not immediate.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said that monetary policy should not react to short-term fluctuations in food and oil prices. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Financial stability was not an issue for the Czech economy, hence there was no need to bring interest rates down to zero.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Thereafter, it would converge slowly from low positive values towards the inflation target, which it would reach at the end of 2010.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the risks of the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Voted in favour of this decision.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The fiscal measures currently under debate and their implications for inflation and monetary policy were also discussed.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said in the discussion that monetary policy should take into account not only the attainment of the inflation target in consumer prices, but also long-term financial stability.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Doubts were repeatedly expressed about whether an interest rate reduction would, in the present situation, have the desired effect on lending, the exchange rate and thus inflation at the monetary policy transmission horizon.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The exchange rate of the koruna would be broadly stable over the forecast horizon. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The prevailing view was that monetary policy rates had fallen to a sufficiently low level to allow the economy to cope with the fall in aggregate demand.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Leaving monetary policy rates unchanged should be enough to enable monetary-policy relevant inflation to return into the lower half of the tolerance band around the inflation target at the forecast horizon.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In support of maintaining the current level of monetary policy rates, it was repeatedly argued that it was risky to make monetary policy changes in an environment of major uncertainty, which is heading in both directions.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In arguing to leave interest rates unchanged, some of the board members mentioned their uncertainty regarding the equilibrium paths specified in the model.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"For some of the board members, the main argument for leaving interest rates unchanged was the forecast assumption of rising interest rates over the next two to three quarters and their unwillingness to make such aggressive monetary policy changes in the opposite direction. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that it was appropriate to leave interest rates unchanged.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed that the economic crisis had not affected the long-run rate of growth of potential output. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the outlook for net exports in relation to the recovery in external economic activity.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The spread between interbank market interest rates and the monetary policy rate was discussed.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The historical statistical indicators may have been deflected by the extreme growth shocks and might be less reliable than under normal circumstances. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Another major uncertainty also discussed by the Board was the evolution of wages and related nominal unit wage costs.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Overall, the Board agreed that wage growth seemed to be a two-sided risk.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that the recovery in the Czech Republic would be driven primarily by exports.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board also spent quite some time discussing the effectiveness of monetary policy during the crisis. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Monetary-policy relevant inflation would approach the target from below.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The new situation report assessed the risks in relation to the forecast overall as being broadly balanced. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"According to the new forecast, inflation would be close to the inflation target at the monetary policy horizon and the economic recovery would be modest.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said repeatedly that according to the new forecast both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation would be close to the inflation target and that such a stable outlook was quite a rare occurrence.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The board members agreed that the current interest rate settings were therefore appropriate.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The new situation report assessed the risks in relation to the forecast overall as being balanced.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing opinion was that the risks of the inflation forecast were balanced and that the appropriate response was to leave rates at the current level.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"External growth was returning, but there was a risk of renewed slowdown. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, would keep rising over the forecast horizon and would converge to the inflation target in 2011 H1.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The prevailing view in the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report was that the current inflation pressures were negligible, inflation expectations were well anchored and the risks of the inflation forecast were balanced.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The majority of the board members agreed that in this situation the appropriate monetary policy reaction was to leave monetary policy rates at their existing level.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"According to this forecast, the domestic economy would continue to be characterised by modest recovery and stable inflation close to the 2% target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"According to the February forecast, both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation would be close to the inflation target at the monetary policy horizon.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The prevailing opinion among the board members was that the current situation ? characterised by lower-than-forecasted GDP, inflation and wages and higher-than-forecasted unemployment ? was not signalling the existence of any demand-pull inflation pressures from the domestic economy.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"However, the prevailing opinion was that inflation expectations were well anchored and that the rise in headline inflation due to the VAT changes would be only temporary, as evidenced by historical experience.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said that commodity prices currently did not represent a major upside risk to inflation and forward contracts suggested that they would not rise any further.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was repeatedly said that owing to weak domestic demand, the observed cost pressures represented by the commodity price growth were not currently an inflation risk. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The majority of the board members regarded the economic situation in Germany as stable and consistent with the forecast. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Higher inflation pressures stemming from the external environment, most notably higher commodity price inflation, were being offset by a sharper decline in domestic inflation pressures.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"A majority of the board members agreed that inflation expectations were well anchored and that the rise in headline inflation due to the potential VAT change would be only temporary, as evidenced by previous experience.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"With regard to the future path of interest rates, the risks were balanced. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing opinion was that the risks to monetary-policy relevant inflation were balanced.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,A majority of the board members did not regard the evolution of the labour market as a risk for inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The initial inflationary pressures stemming from the domestic economy were not significant, owing to weak domestic demand.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"According to the new forecast, headline inflation would be just above 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but would return to the target at the start of 2013.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Some of the board members expressed the view that the economic recovery was unbalanced not only abroad, but also in the domestic economy, and that it was being driven predominantly by exporters.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Domestic economic developments were broadly in line with the forecast and the deviations from the forecast were so far small and in both directions.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was added that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in the long run. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed that the risk to lending to the domestic economy posed by the deleveraging in the euro area and the fulfilment of the new regulatory requirements by European banks was not yet clear.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed several times that owing to the external situation there were risks and uncertainties that were difficult to quantify. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Monetary-policy relevant inflation was in the upper half of the tolerance band around the inflation target.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,In 2013 the economic was expected to grow by just under 2% in connection with a recovery in external demand.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the structure of inflation and future scenarios for inflation,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board then discussed economic growth.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"According to the new forecast, headline inflation would be close to the CNB?s 2% target this year despite substantial impacts of tax changes, and would fall slightly below the target after these impacts fade away. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Monetary-policy relevant inflation would be in the lower half of the tolerance band around the target until the end of 2014,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Overall, the effect of these external factors on the domestic economy was approximately neutral, whereas in the previous forecast it had been slightly anti-inflationary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The exchange rate of the koruna and interest rates were in line with the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, it was said repeatedly that the data that had been published since the last situation report did not represent significant deviations from the forecast from the perspective of inflation pressures.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"However, the opinion was also expressed that the forecast reflected all the available information and that no additional downside risks were visible.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said several times that the 2% inflation target was a significant anchor of inflation expectations and that a long-term undershooting of the target should not be tolerated.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion of the growth outlook for the domestic economy, it was said repeatedly that the government?s declared intention to ease its fiscal consolidation drive was relevant information.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said several times that there was no apparent risk of deflation despite the accumulation of anti-inflationary factors, and that inflation expectations were anchored, or not falling. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,There was a consensus that the data coming in from the domestic economy were not clear-cut. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board clearly agreed that the economy was moving essentially in line with the forecast from the fifth situation report. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was also said that the monetary developments were also signalling no risks of deflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board agreed that the risk mentioned in the previous situation report regarding a later external economic recovery was not currently materialising. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Bank Board went on to discuss the domestic factors underlying inflation and agreed that the domestic economy was not inflationary in its effect.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Monetary-policy relevant inflation would return towards the target at the end of this year and stay very close to the target next year.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the context of the long period of low interest rates, the value of the equilibrium real interest rate for the Czech economy was also discussed.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The weakened exchange rate was passing through to inflation in line with the forecast. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The new forecast was based on an assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until 2015 Q3.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy would not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the intervention regime started. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said that while the domestic economic situation was not currently subject to major uncertainties, the situation abroad was very unbalanced. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board spent quite some time discussing the uncertainties and risks associated with developments abroad.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,A majority of the board members stated that the adoption of the exchange rate commitment had served its purpose.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Monetary policy had thus helped inflation to step back from the edge of deflation, the threat of which, in the light of developments abroad, had been even greater than suggested by the analyses available a year ago. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In quarter-on-quarter terms, economic activity had increased in line with the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said in the discussion that if the standard interest rate instrument were available, its use would lead to a faster return of inflation to the 2% inflation target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed in detail developments on the labour market and the reasons why the favourable tendencies in employment and unemployment were not yet being reflected in faster wage growth. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The new forecast was based on an assumption that market interest rates would be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate would be used as a monetary policy instrument until the end of 2016, i.e. over the entire forecast horizon.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said several times that the situation was little changed from the previous situation report from the economic perspective.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was repeatedly noted that even in the light of the newly available data, the assumption that inflation would merely be approaching the target from below at the monetary policy horizon remained in place.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,Adjusted inflation excluding fuels had stayed positive and stable despite fade-out of the direct effect of the weakened exchange rate of the koruna against the euro and still subdued inflation abroad.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was also said several times that it was good idea to wait for more data to confirm positive tendencies in the economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed whether it was necessary to further ease the monetary conditions and also discussed a possible way of doing so.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said several times that in the current situation it was appropriate to wait and see whether inflationary tendencies materialised in the domestic economy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The opinion was repeatedly expressed that in the present regime, domestic monetary policy was being significantly affected by the ECB?s unconventional monetary policy and that any exit from the CNB?s exchange rate commitment before the ECB?s quantitative easing was discontinued could be very complicated.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In connection with the extension of the exchange rate commitment, the board members discussed the necessary exit conditions.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The evolution of oil prices was a significant source of uncertainty in both directions.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In line with the new forecast, the Board also stated that the Czech National Bank would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the same time, the Board stated that any exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment would be dampened, among other things, by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters during the existence of the commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors, and by possible CNB interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The prevailing view was that negative rates were not an appropriate tool for easing monetary conditions and hence for influencing inflation directly at the monetary policy horizon.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board also discussed the possibility of introducing negative interest rates. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,This was one of the factors helping inflation to return to the target in the first half of next year in the forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"As expected, annual growth in the Czech economy had slowed to 3% in 2016 Q1.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said repeatedly that the new information contained no major surprises and the forecast had largely materialised.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board also discussed the risks and uncertainties arising from developments abroad. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The board members agreed that the referendum result primarily implied an increase in uncertainty and that the main economic impacts associated with the probable Brexit lay beyond the monetary policy horizon, so they were not particularly relevant to current decision-making.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,There was a consensus that the appropriate response was to leave monetary policy rates unchanged at technical zero.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board stated again that the CNB would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed domestic economic developments and their effect on inflation.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was said that core inflation was still developing favourably, moving at the boundary of the tolerance band around the target.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board discussed the existing commitment that the CNB would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before the start of 2017.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The board members agreed that macroeconomic developments in the last quarter had essentially confirmed the predictions of the previous forecast, as the external inflation pressures and the decline in commodity prices were both gradually fading.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said several times that it would be wrong to overestimate the effect of volatile items on the inflation outlook.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Nonetheless, a majority of the board members agreed that the slowdown in industrial production growth and the drop in exports were temporary.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In 2016 Q4, both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation had risen sharply and returned to the tolerance band around the CNB?s target. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In December, headline inflation had hit the 2% target following four years of exceptionally low values. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The forecast assumed that market interest rates would be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate would be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In connection with the timing of the exit, the board members discussed the robustness of the current inflation trend.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,A key question was whether the factors of the currently elevated inflation would persist at the monetary policy horizon.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In this regard, the opinion was expressed that a large part of the deviation of inflation from the forecast was due to one-off factors that would fade away over one year.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"As for the assessment of the domestic economic situation, a majority of the board members did not see any major risks, although GDP growth had been slightly weaker than forecasted at the end of last year. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was also repeatedly said that the economy was in a situation of full employment and was close to its potential output level.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The regular board meeting was devoted exceptionally to, among other things, a discussion of monetary policy issues.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the start of the meeting, the Board was informed about the latest macroeconomic indicators.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The February 2017 foreign trade figures had been in line with the current CNB forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Currently, by contrast, inflation had reached roughly the level that the CNB had considered optimal when the exchange rate had been introduced.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The CNB stood ready to use its instruments to mitigate potential excessive exchange rate fluctuations if needed.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Despite having slowed last year, the Czech economy remained close to its potential output level.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The exit from the exchange rate commitment at the start of April represented a shift of monetary policy towards a neutral stance.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The board members also discussed domestic and foreign political risks. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,There was a consensus at the meeting that the forecast contained in the third situation report was being fulfilled very well. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"It was also discussed whether the observed GDP growth figures, and above all the private consumption data, were low given the labour market developments, sentiment in the economy, residential housing market developments and growth in tax receipts. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Another hypothesis mentioned was the possibility of a decrease in the sensitivity of inflation to real variables (a flattening of the Phillips curve), not only in the Czech economy, but on the global scale. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"The annual headline inflation rate had been 2.5% in August, the same as in the previous month.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Core inflation had gone up slightly again to 2.7%, in line with the forecast.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Domestic inflation would stay above the 2% target for most of 2018, though within the tolerance band. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The opinion was expressed that a sharp increase in interest rates could be counterproductive from the financial stability perspective by putting an excessive load on indebted entities. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, a majority of the board members assessed the risks to the current forecast as being balanced and insignificant. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Thus, the upside risks identified at the November monetary policy meeting had not materialised so far. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It had thus remained in the upper half of the tolerance band around the CNB?s target.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"At the same time, it stated that there were two bidirectional uncertainties of the forecast. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The rate of growth of the Czech economy had stayed at 2.4% in Q3.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In the context of the domestic and foreign risks discussed above, the prevailing opinion among the board members was that the central bank should be forward-looking and prudent.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Overall, however, the inflation pressures were no longer increasing.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,It was said repeatedly during the meeting that the new forecast provided a credible and consistent story. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The Board devoted part of its discussion to the question of credibility and the question of the interpretation of fulfilment of the 2% inflation target.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"In 2019 Q2, GDP growth had continued at a roughly unchanged pace, in line with the forecast. ",Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,The overall message of the new labour market and economic activity data was broadly neutral with respect to the current forecast.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,A majority of the board members noted the complexity of the situation and weighed between keeping rates unchanged and increasing them. ,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,A majority of the board members assessed the risks to the forecast as being significant but not tilted in either direction overall.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,There was a consensus that there was no need to change monetary policy.,Czech National Bank,Czechia
neutral,"Old?ich D?dek emphasised that the Czech Republic was not visibly out of line with the rest of the EU in terms of HICP inflation, so there did not seem to be anything specific in domestic inflation requiring a firm monetary policy response.",Czech National Bank,Czechia
dovish,"Several other members noted that not only supply factors, but also demand factors could explain the recent slowdown in economic growth, which, in turn, could dampen the disinflationary effects of lower growth.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,Most major emerging market economies were decelerating.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"The downward effect on inflation of the decline in domestic demand, which Bank staff assumed with a considerable degree of caution due to a lack of past empirical data, might actually be stronger than in the inflation projection.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"Net wage growth was significantly slower than gross wage growth, which, in turn, was expected to dampen domestic demand. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,Falling demand was likely to prevent an increase in inflation expectations. ,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"On one argument, the current monetary conditions acted to slow output growth over the short term, which might have a stronger-than-expected disinflationary impact. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,Other members proposed that it should be cut by 25 basis points. ,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"One of the members, however, argued that, due to the reduction of the required premium, the time had come for an immediate 25 basis-point cut.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"The rate of wage growth was likely to slow, because of the slowdown in economic activity.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"And with the expected deterioration in economic conditions and the associated slackening in demand, downward effects on inflation could be intensifying.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,The risk of a permanent increase in inflation expectations decreased considerably. ,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,Expected developments in core inflation suggested that there might be a transition to a lower inflation environment over the forecast period.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"Another argument for cutting the interest rate was that the developments in the prices of market services had been in line with the trends observed in earlier years, and there were no visible signs of inflationary pressure.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"In addition, several members also mentioned that, according to the labour force survey, adjustment through lay-offs in the market services sector was stronger than expected, thus the increase in productivity could be higher, while the increase in unit labour costs could be lower than presumed earlier.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,This projects a decline in cost-side inflationary pressure.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"Overall, most Monetary Council members shared the view that the favourable developments in inflation, labour market developments indicating decreasing risks of inflation and the decline in the risk premium allow a cautious interest rate cut.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

dovish,"Following a discussion of the macroeconomic and financial market developments, proposals were submitted to maintain the base rate or to reduce it by 25 basis points.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,Members were unanimous in their views about the disinflationary effects of the slowdown in demand caused by the stronger-than-expected decline in economic growth.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
dovish,"Second, they noted that August?s was the second consecutive Report which contained a lower inflation projection than the target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

dovish,"One member noted that by restraining administered price rises, the Government?s anti-inflation policy had greatly contributed to inflation falling to historically low levels.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

hawkish,"Under these circumstances, decisive action could reinforce the role of the inflation target in guiding expectations, and consequently, they could reduce the real economic costs of achieving price stability.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"However, several other members stressed that available information and the logic of inflation targeting implied a continuation of the tightening cycle and further increases in interest rates in a series of small steps.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Several members noted that the rise in international commodity prices and global inflationary pressures played a major role in this development, which, however, could be even more sustained than assumed in the May Report.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"In addition, the actions taken by the Government could make a significant contribution to an increase in the potential growth rate of the economy and to securing a sustainable debt path for the country.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Members agreed that there were a number of signs that financial market sentiment may have turned around, with a positive shift in sentiment towards emerging countries, and Central and Eastern Europe in particular. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Monetary Council members also agreed that there had been a sustained and significant improvement in perceptions of risks associated with the Hungarian economy over recent months and that the risk of contagion through CEE financial markets had diminished.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Members agreed that there had been a clear, albeit previously unexpected, improvement in perceptions of risks in the past month. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"With the favourable changes in conditions in global financial markets, CDS spreads and government bond yields in Central and Eastern European countries had fallen, and exchange rates had appreciated.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Several members agreed that the improvement in the global growth outlook pointed to a possible increase in the risk of imported inflation through a faster-than-expected rise in oil and commodity prices.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Nevertheless, domestic developments also pointed to a higher inflation path. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Several members noted that anchoring inflation expectations, i.e. keeping inflationary pressures from taking hold with the economic recovery, was becoming a key issue as demand picked up. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Others, however, judged last month?s jump in services prices and the widening in the gap between manufacturing and service sector wage indices to be bad news for the inflation outlook.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,The latest inflation data suggested that prices would rise more rapidly over the near term than in the baseline projection in the August Report.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Inflationary pressure arising from postponed price hikes might build up as the recovery proceeded.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Some members, however, noted that monetary policy should respond immediately to potential future rises in inflation risks, because at the moment inflation could be reduced at much lower costs as a consequence of the balance sheet effects for households.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Some members, however, were of the view that households had responded to the economic recession in part by reining back consumption spending and that latent inflationary pressures might arise once consumption picked up as the economy gradually recovered.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Some members noted that perceptions of the risks associated with the economy had fallen over the past six weeks, due mainly to an improvement in global appetite for risk and the  Government?s commitment to meeting this year?s deficit target of below 3%.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The baseline projection for inflation was above the target over the period to 2012, assuming unchanged monetary conditions.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"It was noted that the disinflation process had come to an end, despite moderate wage growth, with the sharp increase in food prices playing a key role.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"In addition, the negative output gap closing earlier than previously expected might also imply higher future inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"By contrast, the recommendations for wage increases, agreed at the National Interest Reconciliation Council, and rises in the price of oil were exacerbating the upside risks to inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Rising consumption, in turn, pointed to a faster-than-expected closing of the negative output gap. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Both developments had potentially negative implications for inflation expectations, as the output gap might be smaller, which might entail more modest disinflationary effects.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The majority of Monetary Council members judged that inflation was likely to be considerably above the Bank?s 3% target in the coming quarters, due to the significant cost shocks hitting the economy.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"That, in turn, might make it difficult to anchor inflation expectations and add to the risk of second-round inflationary effects.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,It was therefore necessary to tighten monetary conditions further.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Some members emphasised that the output gap might close faster than assumed in the November projection, due in part to a pick-up in consumption and in part because the level of potential output might be much lower than previously assumed, primarily as a result of the persistently low level of capital accumulation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Several members noted that the food and oil price shocks might well lead to stronger inflationary pressures over a sustained period and that upside risks to inflation had increased relative to the November projection.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Others also emphasised that inflationary pressures in Europe could be expected to pick up.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"To facilitate a decision, Pter Bihari supported an increase of 25 basis points in interest rates.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Several members took the view that there was a significant possibility that the cost shocks would be passed through into prices and, as a result, inflation would remain above the target in 2012.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Members agreed that there had been a slight reduction in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy and, as a result, investor demand for forint-denominated assets had increased.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Commodity price rises and their faster pass-through posed upside risks.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"During the period since March, both inflation and core inflation have been higher than the projection in the Bank?s March Quarterly Report on Inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,One member noted that the significant increase in the minimum wage could add to cost- push inflationary pressure.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"At the same time, the improvement in investor sentiment had had a favourable impact on domestic and international financial markets over the past month. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Several members noted that inflation was likely to rise only temporarily at the beginning of this year due to the increase in indirect taxes.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The consumer price index was expected to rise significantly, reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"However, several members noted that the consumer price index for March appeared to confirm the assumption in the Report that the pass-through of the VAT increase to prices was faster and greater than previously thought.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The consumer price index was likely to remain above the inflation target over the policy horizon, reflecting the effects of tax changes, administrative measures and rising commodity prices.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish," Members agreed that CPI inflation in June and July had been higher than previously expected, as a result of higher unprocessed food prices and the increase in excise duties in the course of the year.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Several members noted that the fiscal adjustment measures expected during the latter part of the year, the higher-than-expected global oil prices and the unfolding food price shock represented additional upside risks to inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Some members thought that despite the correction in June, the extent of the pick-up in wage growth posed an upside risk to inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"This was suggested by the increase in underlying inflation in recent months, which might be explained by the fact that economic agents? inflation expectations may have increased, due to the protracted period of above-target inflation and the continuing cost shocks to the economy.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"In that case, the likelihood of so-called second-round inflationary effects of the cost shocks, working through expectations, was greater.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Inflation had picked up in September, largely reflecting rises in food and fuel prices. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Some members noted that the measures represented significant upside risks to inflation.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Decision-makers agreed that global market sentiment was supportive at present, which had a positive impact on perceptions about Hungary.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"In the Council?s judgement, economic growth was likely to pick up gradually in the coming quarters.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Export growth was expected to continue in line with the rate of growth of external demand, which was projected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,The preliminary estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter suggested a gradual improvement in the outlook for economic growth.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Growth was expected to accelerate further in the coming quarters, driven by both exports and domestic demand components.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Rising exports were likely to play a role as a source of growth, supported among other factors by an increase in market share due to the establishment of new production capacities in the automobile industry, in addition to the recovery in external activity.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Domestic demand was expected to strengthen in the coming years.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Whole-economy investment was likely to pick up further, bolstered by the increasing use of EU funding.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Incoming data showed that economic growth had continued in the fourth quarter, as reflected by monthly data on industrial production, the trade surplus, construction output and retail trade turnover. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"However, the depreciation of the forint in recent months passed through gradually into the prices of core inflation items, which in turn pointed to higher underlying inflation.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,Capacity utilisation was likely to rise steadily as economic activity continued to recover. ,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"According to labour market data for March, demand for labour had increased and unemployment had fallen, pointing to a tighter labour market going forward.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Growth was expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced structure, with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The CDS spread, foreign currency bond spreads and long-term yields had declined.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"In the risk scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion, inflation moved in line with price stability in the medium term under considerably tighter monetary conditions than implied by the baseline projection.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"A third scenario, assuming a pick-up in domestic employment and consumption and, consequently, strongergrowth in domestic activity, also implied a tighter monetary policy stance.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Despite the pick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation was expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary?s export markets.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"Investment was likely to continue accelerating, reflecting the increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank?s Funding for Growth Scheme.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
hawkish,"The trade surplus, while remaining substantial in the coming years even as imports continued to rise due to increasing consumption and investment, was likely to keep the current account surplus high over the coming years.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

hawkish,"In the coming quarters, domestic demand was still likely to be the main engine behind growth.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

hawkish,The Hungarian economy had grown dynamically again in the fourth quarter of 2015.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

hawkish,"As expected, the Fed had decided to raise interest rates and, looking ahead, had moved towards a tighter policy path.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

neutral,"In contrast with these scenarios, the risk that the euro-area sovereign debt crisis would escalate had increased.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

neutral,"Firstly, the latest wage and inflation data did not deviate too much from earlier expectations.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Secondly, other factors which suggested some upward pressure on inflation mainly reflected one-off price shocks and, particularly as regards wage data, changes in the regulatory environment.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,Members agreed that there remained significant uncertainty around the central projection in the Report.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Wage data for 2006 may have been distorted by the changing seasonal pattern of bonus payments due to increases in tax and contribution rates, as well as by the one-off effects of the tightening in labour market regulations.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Consequently, the underlying developments could not be assessed accurately at present.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"For these members, one reason for maintaining a ?wait-and-see? approach was that the subdued outlook for growth in the private sector could have a moderating effect on pay rises at the beginning of the year, and moreover, it was conceivable that the current risks would not materialise.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"In this regard, wage developments over the coming months might be of crucial importance. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Members arguing for maintaining rates attached much importance to the fact that the central projection had been changed considerably on the relevant horizon relative to November, and that it had been revised down to a level consistent with the inflation target.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Following discussion of the latest macroeconomic news and financial market developments, the only proposition offered to the Council was to maintain interest rates. ",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

neutral,"Several members emphasised that the uncertainty concerning inflation will last as long as more accurate information concerning the trends on the labour market and inflation-related outlooks are not available, which requires a cautious interest rate policy.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"Although the upward revision to the projection mainly reflected the higher forecast for energy prices and so it was believed to be a temporary factor, with its effect unwinding by 2009, the uncertainty around the central projection pointing to higher inflation should not be ignored.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"After the discussion, the Chairman invited members to vote on the three propositions.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"However, they emphasised that developments in the interest rate path are influenced by a number of factors which are external from the aspect of monetary policy, thus the present interest rate step does not mean any commitment with regard to future interest rate decisions.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,Based on the latest wage data it is still not clear that the risk of sticking wage inflation became lower.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,The members essentially agreed that it continued to be difficult to assess the developments on the labour market.,Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"The changes in the regulatory environment considerably distort the data on wages and employment, therefore it would be misleading to rely only on a single indicator; all available information must be used before making the decision.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary
neutral,"The majority of members present at the meeting agreed that the outlook for inflation was basically favourable, similarly to earlier months.",Hungarian National Bank,Hungary

dovish,Those members also pointed to a decreasing wage pressure in the Polish economy.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"They also argued that amidst weakening external and domestic demand, falling demand for labour would cause faster that accounted for in the February inflation projection decline in wage growth which would be conducive to a reduction of growth in unit labour costs.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

dovish,It was also indicated that deteriorating financial situation of enterprises was hindering their investment activity.,National Bank of Poland,Poland

dovish,"Moreover, the decline in inflation might be curbed in the longer term by structural changes in the Polish economy boosting demand for market services.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the June projection of the NBP pointed at the considerable widening of the negative output gap leading to a strong decline in inflationary pressure over the monetary policy transmission horizon.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"In the assessment of some Council members, economic growth in Poland may run below the central path of the June projection of the NBP, among others, due to the possibly lower economic activity abroad than accounted for in the projection, weaker than projected investment growth connected with the negative business sentiment and a stronger increase in unemployment along with the ensuing drop in households? disposable income.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"On the one hand, further decline in Polish exports and persisting negative annual growth in industrial output (including the output of intermediate and investment goods), deepening fall in employment in the corporate sector, growing unemployment rate and further decline in bank lending all pointed to the continuation of low activity in the Polish economy.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"While discussing interest rates, some members of the Council pointed out that the real ex ante rates, i.e. rates deflated with expected inflation, remained positive, which combined with the output gap remaining negative, could justify further NBP rate cuts.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,A significant drop in inflation in 2010 would be driven ? in the opinion of those members ? by the delayed effects of labour market deterioration resulting both in reduced consumption demand of households and slower growth of costs in enterprises.,National Bank of Poland,Poland

dovish,"While addressing forecasts, those members argued that inflation in 2009 Q2 and Q3 proved markedly higher than expected in the June projection.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"In the opinion of some members of the Council this course of future inflation will follow from weaker consumption demand, persistently low wage pressure and the appreciation of nominal zloty exchange rate so far.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"In the opinion of those Council members, GDP growth in Poland would be negatively affected also by such factors as: the deteriorating situation in the labour market, including rising unemployment and the fall in real wages in the enterprise sector, the decline in corporate loans and lending to households growing more slowly than in the last years, as well as the difficult situation of the public finance sector.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

dovish,"In the opinion of those Council members the strong decline in inflation would be driven primarily by base effects connected with high increases in regulated prices at the beginning of 2009 and by a decline in import prices being the result of the hitherto observed zloty appreciation, which will also contribute to the decline in core inflation.

dovish,"Those members also pointed out that the persistently unfavourable situation in the euro area labour market contributed to curbing consumer demand, which was reflected in the decline in retail sales in the first months of 2010.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"While analysing the outlook for inflation, some members of the Council pointed out that in line with the available forecasts the CPI inflation in the coming months would be running below the NBP inflation target.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"This would primarily result from a moderate demand pressure reflected in low production capacity utilisation, recently observed zloty appreciation and low growth of labour costs in the economy, including their decline in industry.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"At the same time, some Council members indicated that inflationary pressures remained low in the major developed economies, where core inflation fell in April 2010 to historically low levels.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"Some members of the Council pointed out that the structure of economic growth in 2010 Q1, including the high share of inventory build-up, might signal slower GDP growth in the months to come.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,They emphasized that low economic activity in the euro area would be a factor curbing GDP growth in Poland.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,Some members of the Council emphasized that intensified financial-market turmoil driven by fiscal imbalances in some Western European countries and potential problems faced by financial institutions from European countries could be a more significant threat to domestic economic growth than the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"While discussing the investment activity of enterprises it was pointed out that corporate investment was being curtailed due to low production capacity utilization, relatively low demand growth and high uncertainty about the outlook for global economic growth as well as about changes in public finances.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

dovish,"It was argued that following a rise observed in August 2010, the subsequent months recorded a drop in the majority of measures of household inflation expectations which were currently at the level close to the NBP's inflation target. ",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"On the other hand, other Council members argued that there was still a risk of a slowdown in the global economic growth, and that domestic demand was dependent on consumer sentiment, which had once again slightly deteriorated in November, and on the level of public investment, which could be delayed.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"At the same time, some Council members noted that, taking into account the increasing percentage of irregular loans, banks would not be willing to ease their lending policies.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"According to these Council members, the limited risk of excessive inflationary pressure was also indicated by the decelerated growth of monetary aggregates over the recent period.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,Members of the Council pointed out that tensions connected with the deep fiscal imbalance gradually spread to other countries and in the future might affect major developed economies.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,Among the factors increasing the uncertainty about the sustainability of economic growth acceleration some members of the Council mentioned the hitherto observed absence of recovery in corporate investment.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
dovish,"They pointed out that the investment activity of enterprises might be curbed by the uncertainty about the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, limited lending, relatively high fiscal burden, as well as by administrative and legal barriers.

dovish,"In turn, few Council members assessed that the current level of the NBP interest rates ? given the signs of a possible significant economic downturn and the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term ? is too high and thus may lead to excessive deceleration of economic growth.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

hawkish,Some Council members assessed that GUS data concerning the growth of wages in the corporate sector in April 2007 and wages in the economy as a whole in 2007 Q1 confirmed that wage growth has been accelerating.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,They indicated that the rapid growth of wages was driving a considerable - and significantly higher than suggested by the NBP April projection - increase in unit labour costs in the economy. ,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"They also emphasised that given the growing importance of global factors in determining domestic inflation developments, an important indicator of domestic inflationary pressure is the growth rate of services prices, which has been gradually rising since mid-2006 and which now significantly exceeds the growth rate of prices of consumer goods and services.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Some Council members pointed out that the increase in inflation expectations is a risk factor for inflation.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Some Council members assessed that the persistently high growth in lending will support strong increase in private consumption, and consequently, in aggregate demand and inflation.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Some Council members pointed out that the rate of GDP growth in Poland still exceeds the growth rate of potential output, leading to a widening of the output gap and a build-up in inflationary pressure.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Strong growth in demand will be supported by a considerable rise in nominal wages and employment, the inflow of transfers of earnings by people working abroad, strong lending growth, including accelerating rise in consumer loans, and an increase in disposable income of households due to a cut in disability pension contributions.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Those members assessed that in the conditions of the currently high production capacity utilisation, the dynamic growth of domestic demand creates a significant risk of inflation growing above the inflation target in the medium term.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Some Council members pointed to a continually high rate of wage growth and to a very fast drop in unemployment, facilitating a further strong rise in wages.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Those members pointed out that acceleration in price growth should also be fuelled by the rise in households? disposable income resulting from the increase in wages, which should support the growth of consumption demand.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Among Council members the opinion prevailed that, due to the accumulation of factors leading to inflationary pressure building up in the economy, sustaining inflation at a level consistent with the target in the medium term requires a monetary policy tightening in the nearest future.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

hawkish,The Council raised the interest rates.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Some Council members pointed out that 2007 Q2 brought acceleration in the pace of wage growth in enterprises, which remained higher than labour productivity growth leading to growth in unit labour costs in this sector.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"A high wage growth in enterprises can also lead to accelerated wage growth in the public sector, where only slight productivity growth was observed, which would be conducive to increased inflation.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Some Council members emphasised that the inflation forecasts used at the NBP pointed to a higher inflation path than it had been forecasted a quarter before. ,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"According to the central projection based on the ECMOD model, in 2009 CPI inflation would approach the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target (3.5%), while core net inflation would actually reach this level.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

hawkish,"They also emphasised that the high growth in investments and restructuring taking place in enterprises were contributing to the growth of potential GDP, which would be easing inflationary pressure.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"In the assessment of those members, the current data indicated that the Polish economy remained in the period of strong growth and that the output gap was positive, which was conducive to raising the inflationary pressure.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Furthermore, the high growth of loans indicated that the growth of domestic demand may be faster than the growth of potential GDP, which could increase the inflationary pressure.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Those members assessed that labour market data signalled building-up inflationary pressure in the Polish economy. ,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,As a result of the discussion some members concluded that the assessment of the inflation outlook based of the ECMOD-based October inflation projection and considering factors not accounted for in the projection indicated that the probability of inflation overshooting the target in the projection horizon was significant and warrant raising interest rates at the October meeting.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Other members of the Council pointed out that the October data on industrial production and retail sales did not signal a weakening of economic activity in Poland. ,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,It was emphasised that the high growth of domestic demand was supported by rapid increase of wages and very good financial results of enterprises. ,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While addressing the current inflation, it was pointed out that following a long period of inflation running below the inflation target, in October the annual growth of consumer price exceeded the inflation target of 2.5%.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"In conclusion of the discussion it was agreed that the sustained fast growth of demand, the tight labour market, the significant increase in current inflation and the risk of the related second-round effects, as well as the expected considerable surge in demand of the public finance sector until the end of 2008, all warranted the assessment that the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target over the monetary policy transmission horizon was significant and this necessitated an interest rate increase at the November meeting.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While discussing current inflation, the Council analysed the causes of the annual growth of consumer prices in November running above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and exceeding the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Some members of the Council indicated that the rise in current CPI inflation was likely to boost inflation expectations.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,It was pointed out that rising inflation expectations might add to wage pressure.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Moreover, some discussants argued that the rise in current inflation ? unlike in 2004 ? took place amidst strong economic growth and tight labour market which increased the likelihood of rising inflation expectations and of the so-called second-round effects.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"It was indicated that wage growth continued to exceed labour productivity growth, which was conducive to growing inflationary pressure.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Some members of the Council believed that counteracting inflation risk within the monetary policy horizon would require interest rates to be raised at the Council meeting in December.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,Those members assessed that the rise in net core inflation and the continuing high growth of food prices will probably result in CPI inflation remaining above the inflation target throughout 2008.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"Other members, however, emphasized that a rise in CPI inflation might boost inflation expectations.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"In the opinion of some members of the Council, tight labour market reflected in the rapid decline in unemployment rate and a swift labour demand growth would not diminish significantly in the time to come due to economic emigration of Poles and persisting differences in the level of wages between Poland and Western European countries.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the growth of retail sales and industrial output in February were significantly higher then expected.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

hawkish,"Some Council members argued that, apart from high wage growth, domestic demand may be additionally driven by growth in credit aggregates, including consumption loans granted to households, which continued at a high level. ",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While discussing the interest rate decision, the Council assessed that the continuing high growth of wages and employment, along with the possibility of increased inflation expectations resulting from higher current inflation and the expected further increase of administered prices, both pointed to the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,It was emphasized that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP?s inflation target set at 3.5% was mainly the result of the previously observed rise in food prices and increases in administered prices.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While addressing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed out that strong growth in wages continued to be the major risk factor for price stability",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,They assessed that ? similarly to many other countries ? the period of heightened inflation may prove longer than expected so far.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"In the discussion about the labour market situation, it was reasoned that high wage growth and growing unit labour costs continued to be major risk factors to inflation in the medium term.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,It was also emphasized that the recent heated public debate about the price growth contributed to boosting inflation expectations.,National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"At the same time, these members pointed out that the high growth of broad money supply observed for the last several years might indicate the persistence of inflationary pressure in the economy.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"On the other hand, attention was paid to a still high growth in consumption loans.",National Bank of Poland,Poland
hawkish,"While discussing the current inflation, some members of the Council also pointed out that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target was mainly connected with the previously effected increases in regulated prices and rising unprocessed food prices.",National Bank of Poland,Poland

hawkish,"It was stressed that the major determinant of this core inflation pattern was the dynamics of excess aggregate demand and of its inflationary pressures, anticipated to be slacker than in the prior projection over the very short term and markedly faster thereafter, amid the relative step-up in the forecasted rate of quarterly GDP growth over the projection horizon, after the significant slowdown in 2016 H2.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was noted that the relatively swifter economic growth was backed by the recent cuts/removal of taxes/non-tax fees and charges, as well as by the new hikes in wages, pensions and other household income, to which added the accommodative real monetary conditions.",National Bank of Romania,Romania

hawkish,"Against this backdrop, Board members referred to the faster-than-expected pick-up in economic growth in 2016 Q4, to 4.7 percent year on year, against 4.3 percent in the previous quarter, implying a likely wider-than-anticipated reopening of the positive output gap.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"This development had however been accompanied by an increase in the fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP, against 1.4 percent a year earlier, and a widening of the current account deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP, from 1.2 percent in 2015.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Discussions on labour market developments referred to the slightly faster rise in the number of employees economy-wide in 2016 Q4, together with the further fall in unemployment rate, which had touched a new record low in January 2017.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Unit wage costs industry-wide had also risen at a swifter annual pace in the first month of this year ? as the growth rate of labour costs had accelerated considerably faster than that of productivity ?, so a protraction of this trend should be examined also in terms of price competitiveness of Romania?s exports.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"During the discussions on future developments, Board members noted that the current short-term forecast reconfirmed the outlook for the annual inflation rate to pick up slightly in the following months.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"On the other hand, private consumption growth ? the driving force behind last year?s step-up in GDP dynamics to 4.8 percent ? had climbed to a nine-year high of 7.3 percent, mainly on account of higher real disposable income.",National Bank of Romania,Romania

hawkish,"Board members observed that the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation had exceeded the forecasted level even more visibly, given its continued advance in Q2 to 1.42 percent in June, whereas the medium-term forecast had anticipated its quasi-stagnation around the 1.04 percent level seen in March.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,The same data indicated private consumption as the engine of the robust economic growth in 2017 Q2.,National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"In that context, Board members pointed out the further double-digit annual dynamics, in the first two months of Q2, of both the average gross wage earnings and the unit wage costs in industry on the consumer goods segment, despite a moderate slowdown across the sector.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"The rise had primarily been driven by the electricity price hike, as well as by fuel price developments and faster core inflation.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members deemed that core inflation behaviour hinted at the build-up of inflationary pressures from fundamentals on the demand and cost sides, amid the more pronounced cyclical position of the economy and the hike in unit wage costs.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was noticed that, on the supply side, the swifter economic growth had benefited from quasi-general support.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was concluded that, against that background, labour market tightening had grown significantly stronger of late and that it might persist, given that specialised surveys and analyses showed moderate employment intentions in the near run, but also major difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting skilled labour, as well as an increased staff turnover rate.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"In that context, it was shown that the annual growth rate of average gross nominal wage earnings economy-wide had picked up further in the period from June to July and consolidated at particularly high two-digit levels from a historical perspective and above those recorded in 2016.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members then analysed, also from the perspective of monetary transmission, the pronounced uptrend in interbank money market rates towards end-Q3, noting that it had partly stemmed from the upward revision of inflation expectations and the stronger expectations on the adjustment of the monetary policy stance, inter alia in light of international financial market developments.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Significant impetus had been given by the reduction in the structural liquidity surplus on the money market, under the simultaneous influence of the key autonomous liquidity factors, with a major role played by the operations in the Treasury account and by non-residents? transactions on the local financial market, the latter reflecting a likely shift in the related risk perception. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was noted that the annual inflation rate had posted a faster-than-forecasted rise during Q3 too, and that, in the absence of all changes in indirect taxes, excise duties and non-tax fees and charges, it would have stood at 2.6 percent in September, marginally above the midpoint of the flat target. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Moreover, Board members considered that, in H2, the annual pace of economic growth would probably exceed that seen in H1, as well as that previously projected, being expected to accelerate in Q3, before slightly slowing in Q4, and thereby carrying the potential for a relatively larger rise in excess aggregate demand.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,The new decline in the unemployment rate to 5.0 percent in September was also referred to. ,National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was noted that, in September, the annual increase in credit to the private sector had continued to accelerate both in nominal and real terms.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"They observed that the annual inflation rate had continued to leap during the first two months of 2017 Q4, going up from 1.77 percent in September to 2.63 percent in October and to 3.23 percent in November, close to the upper bound of the variation band of the flat target and significantly above the forecast.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"As for the cyclical position of the economy, Board members remarked that, in Q3, economic growth had witnessed the fourth successive faster-than-expected acceleration, which had also been the most significant one; the annual growth rate of GDP had climbed to 8.8 percent, from 6.1 percent in Q2, given that, contrary to forecasts, its quarterly rate had followed a more pronounced upward trend to a ten-year high. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members deemed that the Q3 developments pointed to a new increase, significantly above expectations, in excess aggregate demand, probably moderated somewhat by the temporary pick-up in potential GDP in that interval, under the impact of the positive supply-side shock from bumper crops.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"In that context, reference was made to the two-digit levels (particularly high from a historical perspective and compared with those recorded in 2016) further posted in Q3 by the annual dynamics of the average gross nominal wage and of the total hourly labour costs.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Following the analysis, Board members found that the current context called for further adjustment of the monetary policy stance via an increase in the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.00 percent.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Under the circumstances, the NBR Board unanimously decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent from 1.75 percent, as well as to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.00 percent from 0.75 percent and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.00 percent from 2.75 percent.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members also noted the influences arising from the dynamics of some international agri-food commodity prices and from the relative weakening of the leu versus the euro, as well as from the likely indirect effects of the increases in the oil price and the prices of some utilities, inter alia in the context in which short-term inflation expectations had been more firmly adjusted upwards in the course of Q4.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Moreover, the economic expansion was seen as very likely to re-enter a decelerating trend in 2017 Q4 - 2018 Q1, with its annual dynamics remaining, however, markedly faster than in the November forecast, implying a relative increase in the positive output gap and its inflationary pressures.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,Board members expressed their concerns about the labour market tightness as well.,National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"At the same time, however, Board members voiced concern over the risk that the strong inflation bout driven by supply-side shocks might trigger significant side effects via the worsening of medium-term inflation expectations and implicitly compound the efforts and costs of bringing inflation back under control, especially amid growing pressures from fundamentals. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Mention was also made of the upside risks induced by a possibly higher increase in corporate costs, along with tighter profit margins, due mostly to the new fiscal and income-related measures, as well as to labour market tightening.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members also noted the contribution of fundamentals, given that the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate had risen faster even than the latest forecast to reach 2.9 percent in February from 2.4 percent in December.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"The evolution of the adjusted CORE2 inflation was deemed to reflect stronger demand-pull and cost-push inflationary pressures, in the context of the economy?s advanced cyclical position and tight labour market conditions. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"At the same time, Board members noticed an increased contribution made also by core inflation, which had continued to accelerate in Q1, exceeding expectations once again.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"It was observed that the slightly faster-than-expected increase had been triggered by supply-side factors, especially the significant, larger-than-anticipated hikes in fuel prices ? amid the rise in the oil price and in the exchange rate of the leu against the US dollar ? and in tobacco product prices.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"However, unit labour costs had posted again a faster annual growth or reported further two-digit dynamics in the first four months of 2018, while short-term inflation expectations had continued to see upward adjustments.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"At the same time, Board members noted that the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector had stepped up April through May compared with the Q1 average. ",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,It was shown that the outlook for economic growth also assumed less accommodative monetary conditions over the projection horizon.,National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,Some Board members underlined that inflation developments in 2018 had validated the NBR forecasts and the central bank?s monetary policy conduct which had not overreacted to the significant rise seen by the annual inflation rate in the summer months.,National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Board members agreed that, based on the new data and assessments, a robust economic growth in annual terms was also expected in the first half of 2019, amid some mild fluctuations in the quarterly growth, so that the positive output gap would likely grow in that period in line with the February forecast.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"Turning to the cyclical position of the economy, Board members remarked that, in Q1, economic expansion had witnessed a stronger-than-anticipated acceleration ? to 5.0 percent from 4.1 percent in 2018 Q4 ?, given an unanticipated rebound in its quarterly dynamics, implying a likely larger advance in excess aggregate demand than the forecast for that period.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
hawkish,"The trade deficit had widened considerably faster than in the same year-earlier period, also triggering a deepening of the current account deficit in annual terms, despite the improvement, in that period, in the primary and secondary income balances.",National Bank of Romania,Romania
