dovish	The main causes of the fall in inflation had been a slowdown in annual food price inflation and an acceleration of the decline in fuel prices.
hawkish	On the labour market, the number of vacancies was rising and the general unemployment rate was falling at a steady, albeit gradual, pace.
neutral	Several members stressed that monetary policy actions could only play a marginal role in resolving the problems facing the region.
hawkish	It was pointed out that lending growth was accelerating, as economic activity in the euro area was recovering.
hawkish	It was emphasised that the high growth of domestic demand was supported by rapid increase of wages and very good financial results of enterprises. 
hawkish	It was said repeatedly that industrial production in the Czech Republic and in its main trading partner countries was rising, as were new orders and loans to non-financial corporations.
hawkish	Among the upward risks, the danger of an increase in inflation expectations and its effect on wage agreements were given special attention.
hawkish	It was pointed out that, during Q3 as a whole, the annual inflation rate had nevertheless confirmed the upward expectations and that, in the absence of the transitory impact of lowering the standard VAT rate from 24 percent to 20 percent, it would have increased to 0.82 percent in September from 0.68 percent in June. 
hawkish	Some members of the Council believed that there is a significant risk that a demand growth exceeding the growth of potential GDP would lead to a rise in costs and, consequently, to higher inflation and widening external imbalance.
neutral	Hungarian financial markets had been relatively calm in the period, with the forint appreciating slightly against the euro.
dovish	The downswing in economic activity abroad was gradually transmitting to the domestic economy as a result of the latter?s strong export orientation.
dovish	The favourable liquidity picture, the decline in lending rates on new business following the successive policy rate cuts and the improvement in the evolution of lei-denominated loans create further prerequisites for the recovery of loans to the private sector. 
dovish	While discussing the domestic economic growth, it was noted that the decline in exports, industrial output and retail sales in the first months of 2009 confirm a considerable slowdown in the economic activity in Poland.
neutral	After the discussion, the Chairman invited members to vote on the propositions.
dovish	Opinions were also expressed that a future rate cut could not be ruled out, depending on how the situation develops. 
dovish	In particular, attention was paid to the negative effects of the large fiscal imbalance in some euro area countries, including worsening consumer sentiment in the peripheral countries of the euro area and the risk of increasing financial market turmoil related to the fiscal problems of Greece.
dovish	Subdued wage dynamics suggested that companies were adjusting to higher production costs mainly through the labour market.
neutral	While considering external conditions the Council members pointed to the continuation of moderate economic activity abroad.
dovish	At the same time, Board members also noted the persistence of downside risks to euro area economic growth, given the uncertainties associated with the 2017 election calendar and with the Brexit negotiations, as well as the challenges to the European banking system. 
neutral	In discussing the current decision, after reviewing the macroeconomic developments, Council members agreed that there had been no events since the previous policy decision which would warrant a change in the current interest rate level.
hawkish	Board members remarked the further increase in the number of employees economy-wide, which had moderated only slightly in February, and the fall in the ILO unemployment rate to 5.3 percent in March.
dovish	The perspectives show a continuation of the disinflation process, though the outlook is still influenced by the developments in the international crisis and the persistence of significant structural rigidities of the domestic economy. 
dovish	The initial inflationary pressures stemming from the domestic economy were not significant at present, owing to weak domestic demand and low wage growth.
hawkish	The baseline projection for inflation was above the target over the period to 2012, assuming unchanged monetary conditions.
neutral	In line with the Bank?s expectations, there had not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages.
neutral	It was said that monetary policy should not react to short-term fluctuations in food and oil prices. 
dovish	For several members, the decline in wage inflation was a positive development, which ? if it proved lasting ? could have a benign impact on inflation expectations and the long-term outlook for monetary policy.
dovish	The MNB?s government securities purchases would take place in the secondary market, and might be conducted at auctions organised by the Bank and in individual secondary market transactions. 
neutral	The majority of the board members agreed that in this situation the appropriate monetary policy reaction was to leave monetary policy rates at their existing level.
dovish	The prevailing view was that the anti-inflationary effect of the strong exchange rate would be significant, thanks mainly to effective competition in the tradable goods sector.
dovish	Global sentiment had deteriorated significantly around the end of the year, due to the turbulence in Russian financial markets and the political events in Greece.
neutral	Other Council members emphasized the absence of imbalances in the domestic economy, pointing to a stable situation in the real estate market, a relatively low private and public debts, a small deficit on the current account and a safe level of Poland's foreign indebtedness.
neutral	Other members of the Council argued, however, that the uncertainty related to macroeconomic developments in the global economy, and in particular, in the euro area, does not allow to assess clearly whether the risk for inflation in the medium term running above the inflation target had considerably increased.
dovish	While addressing investment in the Polish economy, it was pointed out that further decline in private investment would be driven by unfavourable outlook for economic growth in Poland and abroad amidst production capacity surplus connected with high level of investment in the previous years.
dovish	The Board discussed the causes of the worse growth outlook for the Czech economy.
neutral	International reserves remain adequate and Romania?s external position is sustainable.
neutral	Moreover, the importance of an adequate dosage and pace of adjustment of the monetary policy stance was reiterated, from the perspective of anchoring inflation expectations and maintaining the annual inflation rate on the trajectory shown by the NBR?s latest medium-term forecast, while safeguarding financial stability.
neutral	Council members agreed that the latest data had not materially altered the outlook for the economy and inflation.
neutral	It had thus remained in the upper half of the tolerance band around the CNB?s target.
neutral	It was also discussed whether the observed GDP growth figures, and above all the private consumption data, were low given the labour market developments, sentiment in the economy, residential housing market developments and growth in tax receipts. 
neutral	The opinion was repeatedly expressed that in the present regime, domestic monetary policy was being significantly affected by the ECB?s unconventional monetary policy and that any exit from the CNB?s exchange rate commitment before the ECB?s quantitative easing was discontinued could be very complicated.
neutral	The Council discussed the appropriate way in which this decision should be communicated to the public.
hawkish	In this context, Board members noted that, in the first two months of 2016 Q4, private sector credit had continued to grow, this time mainly due to the performance of loans to non-financial corporations. 
hawkish	While addressing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, the majority of the Council argued that GDP growth in subsequent quarters may be stronger than previously assessed. 
dovish	One member firmly rejected the option of raising interest rates and argued in favour of reducing rates, as an interest rate increase would send the economy into recession, which would add to inflation through spiralling effects rather than reducing it.
neutral	The above-mentioned factors reveal the need to maintain a prudent monetary policy stance.
neutral	However, it was also said repeatedly that the economic developments in 2007 Q1, which had seen atypical weather conditions, did not necessarily have sufficient information content to distinguish between short-term fluctuations and trends, hence it was too early to talk of a build-up of inflationary factors.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, under the current circumstances monetary policy had to adopt a wait-and-see approach.
dovish	Several members noted that, due to the poor economic prospects, the country?s vulnerability had increased, despite a fall in the external financing requirement.
hawkish	Some members, however, noted that monetary policy should respond immediately to potential future rises in inflation risks, because at the moment inflation could be reduced at much lower costs as a consequence of the balance sheet effects for households.
hawkish	In all probability, higher-than-expected gross wages in the private sector reflected an increase in inflation expectations and contributed to cost-push inflation pressures.
hawkish	The starting conditions of the forecast assumed comparatively strong demand-pull inflation pressures from the real economy, stemming primarily from the positive output gap. 
hawkish	The new forecast had also taken into account the higher-than-expected rise in inflation in late 2007, which it assessed as a one-off shock linked mainly with external developments.
neutral	This was also supported by the external environment, as global inflation and the ECB?s monetary policy stance had remained broadly unchanged.
dovish	It was also argued that due to the economic slowdown in Western Europe, one could expect increased returns of Poles from economic migration and, consequently, a rise in the number of the economically active persons, which would contribute to further easing of the wage pressure. 
dovish	The annual price index had fallen below the Bank?s 3% target by February.
neutral	In line with the Bank?s expectations, there had not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages.
hawkish	In quarter-on-quarter terms, economic activity had risen for the third consecutive quarter.
neutral	According to information currently available, the inflation target could be met in 2008.
dovish	The ECB had launched a Treasury bond purchase programme, and conducted another TLTRO operation on a larger-than-expected scale.
neutral	The Board discussed in depth the current situation in financial intermediation.
neutral	For these members, one reason for maintaining a ?wait-and-see? approach was that the subdued outlook for growth in the private sector could have a moderating effect on pay rises at the beginning of the year, and moreover, it was conceivable that the current risks would not materialise.
dovish	In particular, in September, the European Central Bank had loosened its monetary policy by decreasing the deposit rate further below zero, announcing the resumption of its asset purchase programme and relaxing the terms of long-term refinancing operations.
hawkish	However, several other members stressed that available information and the logic of inflation targeting implied a continuation of the tightening cycle and further increases in interest rates in a series of small steps.
hawkish	Incoming data showed that economic growth had continued in the fourth quarter, as reflected by monthly data on industrial production, the trade surplus, construction output and retail trade turnover. 
hawkish	Economic growth of around 3 per cent could be maintained by the extension of the Funding for Growth Scheme, the Growth Supporting Programme and the Government?s measures to promote housing construction as well as by the faster drawdown and efficient use of EU funding.
neutral	At the same time, the majority of Council members indicated that the substantial tightening of monetary policy implemented since the beginning of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term, and further tightening of monetary policy would be justified should the prospects of inflation returning to the target deteriorate.
hawkish	However, mention was made in the discussion of the good condition of the German economy, which was benefiting from exports to non-European markets.
hawkish	With regard to the economic recovery, mention was made of improving leading indicators such as growth in industrial orders and consumer confidence indicators, in respect of which households? persisting concerns about rising prices were emphasised.
hawkish	The historically high investment rate was expected to continue rising on the forecast horizon.
hawkish	On the other hand, concerns remain regarding the potential significant second round effects of the VAT increase.
hawkish	Inflationary pressures have been amplified by persistent excess demand as a consequence of strong wage increases and fast growth of credit to the private sector.
dovish	There was also an in-depth discussion of the exchange rate, which had depreciated significantly as a result of the substantially worse economic outlook and financial market panic.
dovish	It was also argued that the drop in the value of households? assets being the result of the downturn in the financial markets might additionally dampen the consumption growth.
hawkish	The Council raised the interest rates to the following levels: the reference rate 4.25%, the lombard rate 5.75%, the deposit rate 2.75%, the rediscount rate 4.50%. 
dovish	Members were unanimous in their views about the disinflationary effects of the slowdown in demand caused by the stronger-than-expected decline in economic growth.
dovish	The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data points to a decline in the annual inflation rate, which followed a path lower than previously forecasted, due to the drop in volatile prices, subdued euro area inflation, the persistence of the negative output gap, and to the ongoing downward adjustment in inflation expectations.
dovish	Referring to consumption and retail sales data, several members noted that in the economic environment characterised by subdued demand, inflation might continue to fall on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.
neutral	The overall message of the new labour market and economic activity data was broadly neutral with respect to the current forecast.
dovish	Considerable attention was also given to developments in the labour market, where the number of vacancies was continuing to fall and unemployment was on the rise. 
dovish	In the monetary area it is worth noting a relative stagnation of intermediation in the context of a significant slowdown of credit to the private sector.
dovish	The unconventional, targeted monetary policy instruments introduced by the Bank facilitated a decline in long-term yields and, consequently, an easing in monetary conditions.
hawkish	This was suggested by the increase in underlying inflation in recent months, which might be explained by the fact that economic agents? inflation expectations may have increased, due to the protracted period of above-target inflation and the continuing cost shocks to the economy.
neutral	Some of the board members emphasised the fact that the rapid appreciation of the koruna in July had returned with renewed vigour in November.
neutral	The Council considered the limit on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change an integral part of monetary policy instruments.
neutral	The multitude of uncertainties and the absence of insight on the concrete measures and the implementation calendar made it impossible as yet to assess the potential macroeconomic and structural effects.
dovish	Some Council members expressed the view that the sluggish expansion in corporate loans might have a curbing effect on investment growth.
dovish	Based on the available information, the Czech economy could be expected to slow sharply or even contract this year.
dovish	This could materialise amid the recent geopolitical and regional tensions, the ongoing cross-border deleveraging and restructuring of some Eurozone banking groups, as well as in the context of uncertainty surrounding the impact of possible monetary policy stance adjustments by major central banks worldwide.
hawkish	The appropriate response should therefore be to raise rates already at the present meeting.
hawkish	Net inflation was steadily rebounding from its previous low values. 
hawkish	At the same time, Board members highlighted the decisive contribution to the outlook for a higher annual inflation rate from fundamentals, captured primarily by core inflation.
dovish	There had been an enormous deterioration in sentiment in global financial markets: markets had been characterised by a general increase in risk aversion and selling pressure.
dovish	On one argument, the current monetary conditions acted to slow output growth over the short term, which might have a stronger-than-expected disinflationary impact. 
hawkish	The NBR carefully calibrated the monetary policy instruments, also by shifting from firm to adequate liquidity management, which led to an improvement of liquidity conditions on the money market and hence drove interbank rates considerably lower.
hawkish	Board members also noted the contribution of fundamentals, given that the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate had risen faster even than the latest forecast to reach 2.9 percent in February from 2.4 percent in December.
neutral	The Board also discussed the risks and uncertainties arising from developments abroad. 
dovish	Among major channels through which the world crisis affected the Polish economy were listed: the decline in external demand, deteriorating agents? expectations as to the future economic situation of the country and tightening of banks? lending policy.
hawkish	It was stressed that a rise in inflation had been driven by the previously observed zloty exchange rate depreciation and that exchange rate developments continued to be the main risk factor for price stability.
neutral	It was said that while the domestic economic situation was not currently subject to major uncertainties, the situation abroad was very unbalanced. 
hawkish	Annual GDP growth had accelerated significantly further to 4.7% in 2017 Q2 and was distinctly above the forecast. 
hawkish	A slower-than-expected wage decline in industry and construction was mentioned as a risk of higher inflation in the future. 
dovish	One member noted that by restraining administered price rises, the Government?s anti-inflation policy had greatly contributed to inflation falling to historically low levels.
hawkish	The board members also positively assessed the fact that the growth was being driven by practically all components of demand. 
dovish	However, the annual rate of change of total loans (in domestic and foreign currency) to the private sector remained in negative territory, despite the relatively improved performance of leu-denominated loans.
dovish	The European Central Bank had raised the total amount of its asset purchase programme (PEPP), had launched to counteract the effects of the pandemic, to EUR 1,350 billion and had extended its horizon.
neutral	At the same time, Board members remarked, however, a significant increase in the uncertainties about the short- and medium-term outlook for the fiscal and income policy stance, likely to generate enhanced uncertainties and two-way risks to the latest medium-term inflation forecast.
dovish	The forecast had responded to the changes in the global environment, in particular the significant fall in the one-year EURIBOR interest rate path resulting from the financial market turmoil, the uncertainty regarding its impact on real economic activity and the resulting monetary policy response.
dovish	As a consequence, economic slowdown of Poland?s main trade partners would translate into a weakened economic activity in Poland. 
dovish	Members of the Council agreed that the global economic environment and the prospects for growth both had deteriorated more sharply than expected, and the current recession may consequently be deeper and more protracted. 
dovish	The NBR Board has also decided to cut the minimum reserve requirements ratios on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 15 percent from 18 percent and on foreign currency-denominated liabilities to 35 percent from 40 percent
hawkish	The opinion was expressed that rapid economic growth should not be a reason for tightening monetary policy.
hawkish	As regards the assessment of domestic economy activity, the Board agreed that the figures from the domestic economy were signalling the start of an economic rebound.
dovish	Considering the first half of 2020 as a whole, the Hungarian economy had exhibited a similar decline to that seen in other countries in the region.
neutral	The Council also discussed the long-term challenges to economic policy. 
hawkish	On the supply side, the key determinant of the pick-up in economic growth was the gross value added in the services sector, which came to account for an unprecedented 60 percent of GDP.
neutral	It was said repeatedly during the meeting that the new forecast provided a credible and consistent story. 
neutral	Board members looked at the monetisation of the economy as well. 
neutral	The Board then discussed economic growth.
dovish	There was a consensus that it was appropriate to leave monetary policy rates at technical zero and that a need to maintain significantly easy monetary conditions persisted. 
hawkish	Rising incomes, the pick-up in lending and the gradual decline in precautionary motives contributed to a substantial expansion in consumption, which in turn provided considerable support for economic growth.
dovish	After the expiry of the impact of these factors ? in the opinion of those Council members ? the growth of household consumption may slacken, which is confirmed by the low growth of real wages.
hawkish	When discussing recent developments in the economy, Board members emphasised the faster than-expected second-quarter growth of 6 percent in annual terms, hinting at a stronger advance in excess aggregate demand, also in the short term.
dovish	Prices of food and fuels had declined as a result of persisting anti-inflationary supply shocks from abroad
hawkish	This development had however been accompanied by an increase in the fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP, against 1.4 percent a year earlier, and a widening of the current account deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP, from 1.2 percent in 2015.
hawkish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth, most members of the Council assessed that GDP growth in the coming quarters would gradually accelerate with consumption and investment remaining its key drivers.
hawkish	In the assessment of those members, the current data indicated that the Polish economy remained in the period of strong growth and that the output gap was positive, which was conducive to raising the inflationary pressure.
dovish	Monetary Council members agreed that in the current economic environment characterised by subdued demand, the outlook for inflation allowed the Bank to reduce the base rate further.
dovish	This projects a decline in cost-side inflationary pressure.
hawkish	Inflation was likely to stay mostly above the central bank's tolerance band until end of the year. 
hawkish	It was noted that activity growth in 2018 Q4 had continued to be driven by consumption, which had been rising further ? albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters ? fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very strong consumer sentiment.
hawkish	Core inflation, calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) prices as well as the effect of vice tax, rose to 6.17 percent in February 2008 from 5.92 percent in the previous month.
neutral	According to the new forecast, headline inflation would be close to the CNB?s 2% target this year despite substantial impacts of tax changes, and would fall slightly below the target after these impacts fade away. 
hawkish	Capacity utilisation was likely to rise steadily as economic activity continued to recover. 
neutral	Some Board members considered that evolution to be a welcome return towards the potential rate of economic growth, since it implied a contraction in excess aggregate demand. 
neutral	It was said repeatedly that uncertainty had increased sharply in several areas in recent weeks.
dovish	Domestic economic activity was also anti-inflationary by comparison with the baseline scenario, as GDP had fallen by 0.7 percentage point year on year in 2012 Q1 whereas the forecast had predicted stagnation.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that a reduction in rates was consistent with the new forecast.
neutral	Following a gradual decline, inflation was likely to stabilise at the 3 percent inflation target in the second half of the forecast horizon.
dovish	The downward correction had owed almost entirely to the decelerations seen in the prices of fuels and VFE, and, to a much lower extent, to declines in the change of tobacco product prices and administered prices, mainly ascribable to base effects and the influence from removing the special excise duty on motor fuels and from the unanticipated fall in the oil price.
dovish	While discussing inflationary developments, members of the Council emphasized that the anticipated weakening of the domestic economic activity, connected with both slowdown in the global economic growth, as well as, tightening of the domestic fiscal policy, would support gradual decline in inflation.
hawkish	Some Council members pointed to the fact that international institutions had increased their forecasts of Poland?s GDP growth for 2011.
neutral	In the opinion of those Council members, the monetary policy should account for shifts in profit margins resulting from the business cycle.
hawkish	Attention was also focused on the high growth in fixed investment, which had come as the biggest surprise compared with the forecast.
dovish	At the same time it decided to lower the discount rate and Lombard rate.
hawkish	Strong growth in demand will be supported by a considerable rise in nominal wages and employment, the inflow of transfers of earnings by people working abroad, strong lending growth, including accelerating rise in consumer loans, and an increase in disposable income of households due to a cut in disability pension contributions.
neutral	The major risks associated with the current projection relate to the lingering uncertainty surrounding external developments, generated by the situation in Greece and in the euro area, by regional geopolitical tensions, and by the divergence between the monetary policy stances of major central banks worldwide.
hawkish	Rising consumption, in turn, pointed to a faster-than-expected closing of the negative output gap. 
neutral	According to the Monetary Council?s opinion, monetary policy decisions should focus on the risks to financial stability and inflation perspectives in the current situation, and should strive to maintain the sustainability of external financing.
hawkish	Continued strong growth in labour demand had led to an upswing in employment growth and a further fall in the unemployment rate, neither of which the forecast had expected. 
neutral	As a result, risks to the outlook for domestic inflation had become balanced again.
neutral	The regular board meeting was devoted exceptionally to, among other things, a discussion of monetary policy issues.
neutral	It was said that commodity prices currently did not represent a major upside risk to inflation and forward contracts suggested that they would not rise any further.
dovish	Delivering price stability in the medium term pointed in the direction of monetary easing. 
dovish	The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators points to a halt in the upward trend of the annual inflation rate, as well as to a slow recovery in Romania?s economy amid the recession in euro area economies.
dovish	Successful disinflation also required that the wage agreements for 2008 be aligned with the expected decline in inflation. 
neutral	The risks related mainly to factors outside the central bank's influence ? administered price adjustments, consistent continuation of the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as well as future developments in external agri-food and commodity prices as well those arising from the international economic environment - require a further prudent monetary policy stance.
neutral	The Board agreed that the risks to the inflation forecast were balanced.
neutral	While discussing business conditions in Poland's external environment, Council members pointed out that global activity growth remained moderate and varied considerably across the regions.
hawkish	Growth was expected to pick up gradually in the quarters ahead and to return to a more balanced structure, with domestic demand likely to make an increasing contribution.
dovish	Nevertheless, the negative output gap is persisting, and the revival of loans to the private sector is still modest, also as a result of banks? pro-cyclical behaviour reflecting uncertainties and risks related to the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the mixed signals on world economy recovery.
hawkish	The currently weaker exchange rate was identified as an upside risk to inflation by some of the board members.
neutral	Board members highlighted the ongoing dual nature of the key uncertainties about developments in inflation fundamentals.
dovish	The expansion of domestic demand and companies? efforts to restore profitability were expected to facilitate the future slowdown in the rate of wage growth. 
hawkish	Decision-makers agreed that global market sentiment was supportive at present, which had a positive impact on perceptions about Hungary.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.97 percent in February 2008 from 7.26 percent in the previous month, mainly due to the upward adjustment of natural gas prices and the persistent impact of the drop in the 2007 agricultural output on food prices.
neutral	The majority of the Council members expressed the opinion that, taking into account current information, interest rates were also likely to remain stable in the coming quarters.
hawkish	The Board discussed the causes of the current higher inflation.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, Hungarian economic growth might continue in a more balanced pattern than previously.
dovish	It had been lower than forecasted, mainly as a result of a one-off shock to food price growth.
hawkish	It was also said, however, that temporarily increased nominal unit wage costs can also be a sign that businesses are gearing up for a further strengthening of demand, and the opinion was expressed that faster-growing wages can be natural for a converging economy.
dovish	By contrast, the construction industry was still in decline as a result of a continued fall in infrastructure investment.
hawkish	In the risk scenario assuming an unfavourable external environment and higher investor risk aversion, inflation moved in line with price stability in the medium term under considerably tighter monetary conditions than implied by the baseline projection.
neutral	A key question was whether the factors of the currently elevated inflation would persist at the monetary policy horizon.
hawkish	It was indicated that the recovery in international trade was supporting economic conditions in the euro area, where economic growth remained higher than in 2016.
dovish	Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates had fallen substantially over recent years and were expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period.
dovish	Members pointed out that external economic activity had slowed down substantially as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
dovish	It was argued that if economic growth in the United States and Europe fell short of previous expectations, then smaller exports of Poland should be expected, resulting in lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressure.
neutral	In the context of the debate of monetary policy transmission mechanisms, it was said that a change in monetary policy rates might also act via the exchange rate channel and that the exchange rate affects the economy more quickly than interest rates.
hawkish	Some Council members underlined that in the United States the annual inflation rate had exceeded 4% and was the highest for a dozen or so years, while core inflation was the highest for three decades.
hawkish	Board members observed that the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation had exceeded the forecasted level even more visibly, given its continued advance in Q2 to 1.42 percent in June, whereas the medium-term forecast had anticipated its quasi-stagnation around the 1.04 percent level seen in March.
hawkish	In 2007, therefore, the economy would grow at a faster pace than the expected rate of growth of potential output.
neutral	The spread between interbank market interest rates and the monetary policy rate was discussed.
neutral	If the assumptions underlying the Bank?s projections held, the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period, over the entire forecast horizon, were consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.
neutral	At the same time, in line with available forecasts, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target.
neutral	While discussing price developments in the world economy, it was noted that despite the global recovery, inflation abroad remained moderate due to the persistently weak domestic inflationary pressure in many countries.
dovish	Members agreed that, with the current interest rate move, the easing cycle would end.
neutral	This Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November, 3, 2008.
neutral	After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the new forecast.
dovish	GDP growth would continue slowing in the coming quarters owing to the dampening effect of the very strong exchange rate and weak external demand on export growth and also as a result of slowing gross capital formation.
hawkish	At the same time, Board members noticed an increased contribution made also by core inflation, which had continued to accelerate in Q1, exceeding expectations once again.
hawkish	The short-term inflation outlook has worsened in the context of heightened macroeconomic risks, especially those related to the income policy and higher public spending in the run-up to forthcoming elections as well as uncertainties over investors ' appetite for emerging market risk.
neutral	According to the new forecast, inflation would be close to the inflation target at the monetary policy horizon and the economic recovery would be modest.
hawkish	Mention was made of the possibility of more robust economic growth in the euro area and globally, driven by the ongoing strongly accommodative ECB monetary policy stance, by the anticipated fiscal stimulus to the US economy, and by the potentially stronger recovery of major emerging economies, amid the rise in international commodity prices.
neutral	Council members also argued that a stabilisation of interest rates ensured room for their adjustment in the case of shocks adversely affecting domestic economic situation and price developments. 
dovish	They also argued that amidst weakening external and domestic demand, falling demand for labour would cause faster that accounted for in the February inflation projection decline in wage growth which would be conducive to a reduction of growth in unit labour costs.
hawkish	While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, a slight upward revision of GDP in 2009 Q4 and better than expected data on industrial output and retail sales were indicated.
neutral	They therefore assessed that the current level of interest rates probably does not prevent widening of the output gap and rise in inflationary pressure.
hawkish	Inflation was likely to be above target this year and the next, which underscored the need for further monetary tightening.
dovish	Based on the inflation data for June, consumer prices continued to show historically low dynamics.
hawkish	World trade and global industrial production were already above the levels seen before the pandemic.
neutral	The weakened exchange rate was passing through to inflation in line with the forecast. 
neutral	At the same time, it was shown that the EUR/RON exchange rate had seen lower fluctuations, under the influence of the relative improvement in global financial market sentiment, as well as amid liquidity conditions on the money market and the interest rate differential.
hawkish	The Czech economy was slightly above its potential output level.
hawkish	Members noted, on the one hand, the balancing trend of the risks to the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the euro area/EU and globally, inter alia amid the ongoing accommodative monetary policy stance, especially in developed countries, and the anticipated fiscal stimulus to the US economy.
dovish	Another issue discussed was the observed slowdown in domestic private investment growth linked with the slackening of economic growth abroad and its effect on domestic inflation.
neutral	In connection with the extension of the exchange rate commitment, the board members discussed the necessary exit conditions.
dovish	Attention was also paid to the stronger than expected decline in CPI inflation in November.
hawkish	The Hungarian economy had grown dynamically again in the fourth quarter of 2015.
hawkish	These risks were assessed in the situation report as being on the upside overall. 
hawkish	According to the forecast, inflation would start rising in the near future, driven by increasing domestic economic activity and wages. 
dovish	Another argument for cutting the interest rate was that the developments in the prices of market services had been in line with the trends observed in earlier years, and there were no visible signs of inflationary pressure.
hawkish	At the same time, Board members noted that the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector had stepped up April through May compared with the Q1 average. 
neutral	Further central bank actions would be decided in the light of the sustainability of the current improvement in conditions.
dovish	A significant drop in inflation in 2010 would be driven ? in the opinion of those members ? by the delayed effects of labour market deterioration resulting both in reduced consumption demand of households and slower growth of costs in enterprises.
neutral	However, the Bank?s measures of underlying inflation had remained stable, in line with expectations.
dovish	They indicated that the demand pressure was low due to the still unfavourable situation in the labour marked.
hawkish	The economy would continue to go through a phase of buoyant economic growth driven by growth in household consumption and investment.
dovish	The GDP remains below potential owing to the evolution of its quarterly growth rate.
neutral	The Board also discussed the link between household consumption and other economic variables.
neutral	They noted that the uncertainty characterising global money and capital markets had spilled over to Hungary.
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would return towards the target at the end of this year and stay very close to the target next year.
hawkish	In the opinion of those Council members, the improving labour market situation, including the relatively fast employment growth in the enterprise sector, would act towards further consumption growth.
dovish	In the context of the turmoil on the financial markets, the Board agreed that lower growth abroad and, as a result, weaker external demand could be expected by comparison with the forecast assumptions. 
hawkish	The pick-up in economic recovery had made it possible for the Bank to phase out certain crisis management tools.
dovish	This would primarily result from a moderate demand pressure reflected in low production capacity utilisation, recently observed zloty appreciation and low growth of labour costs in the economy, including their decline in industry.
dovish	Several members briefly reviewed the macroeconomic effects of the Bank?s easing cycle that had begun in August 2012 and agreed that there remained scope for some policy easing.
neutral	While discussing price developments abroad, it was emphasised that despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad had remained moderate.
hawkish	At the same time, the improvement in investor sentiment had had a favourable impact on domestic and international financial markets over the past month. 
hawkish	Annual consumer price inflation had risen to 2.5% in April and was thus 0.4 percentage points higher than forecasted. 
hawkish	Among Council members the opinion prevailed that, due to the accumulation of factors leading to inflationary pressure building up in the economy, sustaining inflation at a level consistent with the target in the medium term requires a monetary policy tightening in the nearest future.
hawkish	Other members, however, emphasized that a rise in CPI inflation might boost inflation expectations.
hawkish	The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate further rose somewhat faster than anticipated.
hawkish	Given the upside balance of risks to inflation, the Board discussed the possibility of raising interest rates. 
hawkish	At its October meeting, the Monetary Council decided to continue to tighten monetary conditions.
dovish	In addition to high prices of commodities and energy, these pressures reflected persisting problems in global production chains.
dovish	Looking at economic activity, reference was made to the stronger-than-expected deceleration of GDP growth in 2016 Q3, given the slower increase in domestic demand, on account of the slowdown in household consumption and gross fixed capital formation.
hawkish	Some members emphasised that the output gap might close faster than assumed in the November projection, due in part to a pick-up in consumption and in part because the level of potential output might be much lower than previously assumed, primarily as a result of the persistently low level of capital accumulation.
neutral	Monetary policy preserved its prudent stance, by adjusting broad monetary conditions to the domestic and global macroeconomic environment.
neutral	The board members agreed that the current interest rate settings were therefore appropriate.
neutral	Incoming macroeconomic data for the past quarter had been in line with the Bank?s expectations.
dovish	At 6.5%, inflation in August had been 0.3 percentage point lower than forecasted.
hawkish	Those members assessed that labour market data signalled building-up inflationary pressure in the Polish economy. 
dovish	On the one hand, it was argued that a reduction of interest rates was desirable since it would allow the interest rate differential to decrease.
neutral	If the assumptions underlying the Bank?s projection held, achieving the medium-term inflation target pointed in the direction of maintaining current loose monetary conditions for an extended period. 
dovish	To maintain price stability and support the recovery of economic growth, fine-tuning of monetary conditions had become necessary.
hawkish	Members also mentioned the risk of indirect inflationary effects of the uptrend in international energy commodity prices becoming manifest, especially amid high wage costs, a possible hint being the upward trajectory of the dynamics of industrial producer prices on the domestic market. 
neutral	The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators reveals that the annual inflation rate will be close to 8.0 percent at the end of 2010, in line with the NBR forecasts.
dovish	During the discussion it was pointed out that 2007 Q4 brought a decline in enterprises? profitability rate of gross turnover.
dovish	In the first half of the forecast period, domestic inflation was likely to be substantially below the target, mainly reflecting cost shocks having downside effects on inflation as well as the weak demand and inflation environment in Hungary?s major trading partner countries.
neutral	Relative to monetary conditions, Board members showed that the spread between the key interbank money market rates and the monetary policy rate had gradually narrowed over the last two months of 2018, mainly amid the change in liquidity conditions, the inflation dynamics and the likely adjustment in banks? expectations on the evolution of some monetary policy parameters.
neutral	The monetary policy stance, assessed via broad monetary conditions, has remained prudent in the context of the previous adjustment in the levels of monetary policy instruments, a faster leu appreciation in the recent period and the removal of some administrative measures limiting non-government credit dynamics.
dovish	In this context, attention was paid to the data suggesting stabilization of economic activity in the United States, while, at the same time, it was pointed out that some recently released data on American economy was worse than expected.
hawkish	Several members noted that the food and oil price shocks might well lead to stronger inflationary pressures over a sustained period and that upside risks to inflation had increased relative to the November projection.
dovish	Monetary aggregate growth in the Czech Republic and in the euro area was currently subdued and not indicating any danger of inflation.
dovish	As regards inflation expectations, it was said that a decrease could be expected. 
dovish	The annual increase in real terms of credit to the private sector has moderated under the impact of reduced access of banks to external financing, of a gradual reduction of the excess liquidity in the banking sector, as well as of increased prudence of banks amid growing uncertainties related to the effects of the global crisis on the Romanian economy.
hawkish	It was also emphasized that GDP growth in 2015 Q1 had been higher than expected. 
neutral	Another hypothesis mentioned was the possibility of a decrease in the sensitivity of inflation to real variables (a flattening of the Phillips curve), not only in the Czech economy, but on the global scale. 
neutral	A majority of the board members noted the complexity of the situation and weighed between keeping rates unchanged and increasing them. 
neutral	In the Council?s assessment, the gradual limitation on the stock of three- month deposits had fulfilled its role and the HUF 75 billion year-end upper limit on the stock would not be reduced further.
neutral	Thus, the upside risks identified at the November monetary policy meeting had not materialised so far. 
dovish	 The Board agreed that the risks and uncertainties were currently extremely high and that the majority of them would come from abroad, owing mainly to the escalation of the debt crisis in the euro area.
neutral	At the same time, domestic demand has seen modest recovery, which is envisaged to strengthen gradually.
hawkish	Looking ahead, whole-economy wage growth was likely to rise further, as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the latest wage agreement.
dovish	The NBR?s current assessments reconfirm the prospects for the annual inflation rate to follow a downward trend, albeit remaining outside the variation band in the forthcoming months, with the persistence of the negative output gap being the main disinflation driver.
dovish	The favourable trends in volatile food prices combined with the fading out of the impact of July 2010 VAT rate hike are forecast to trigger faster disinflation in the coming months.
neutral	The Board agreed that there were risks on both the upside and downside.
hawkish	It was remarked that the latest developments pointed to economic growth slowing down in Q3, although remaining above potential, which implied the further widening of the positive output gap and hence the strengthening of the ensuing inflationary pressures.
neutral	Economic activity might begin to normalise from the second quarter of 2021 as the coronavirus vaccine became widely available.
hawkish	It was said that both the current data and the forecast were indicating that inflation was sustainable with respect to future fulfilment of the target thanks in part to favourable labour market developments in the form of rising employment and upward pressure on wages.
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period.
dovish	Some members warned that the country?s relative position had even deteriorated further compared with Poland and the Czech Republic.
neutral	In the current volatile financial market environment, the fundamentals of the Hungarian economy continued to be stable.
hawkish	The growing economic activity would be reflected in an increase in wage growth.
neutral	In 2019 Q2, GDP growth had continued at a roughly unchanged pace, in line with the forecast. 
dovish	Some Council members emphasised that the structure of the current economic growth is favourable to low inflation.
hawkish	As a whole, investor sentiment in global financial markets had improved recently.
neutral	Looking at the recent inflation developments, Board members observed that the annual inflation rate had stood at 3.32 percent at end-2017, i.e. inside the ñ 1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent target.
hawkish	It was emphasized that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the NBP?s inflation target set at 3.5% was mainly the result of the previously observed rise in food prices and increases in administered prices.
hawkish	The real growth rate of domestic currency loans picked up thanks to the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households.
hawkish	Robust economic growth might continue, supported by rising external demand, in addition to growing domestic demand.
hawkish	Significant impetus had been given by the reduction in the structural liquidity surplus on the money market, under the simultaneous influence of the key autonomous liquidity factors, with a major role played by the operations in the Treasury account and by non-residents? transactions on the local financial market, the latter reflecting a likely shift in the related risk perception. 
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, a cautious approach to policy was warranted due to uncertainty about future developments in the global financial environment.
neutral	Employment and unemployment had been broadly unchanged.
hawkish	Higher adjusted inflation excluding fuels had also contributed to the pick-up in consumer price inflation, reflecting accelerating growth of the domestic economy, an improving labour market and a weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the dollar.
dovish	 On the supply side, the bumper agricultural year and the industrial output made the largest contributions to economic growth.
hawkish	Members agreed that there were a number of signs that financial market sentiment may have turned around, with a positive shift in sentiment towards emerging countries, and Central and Eastern Europe in particular. 
dovish	According to the new forecast, inflation would stay slightly below the target this year.
neutral	During the discussion of the policy decision, members summarised their arguments in favour of and against an interest rate reduction.
dovish	Several other members, however, were of the view that, based on the latest data, labour market conditions had eased further and the fall in corporate profitability would be able to effectively control the outcome of wage negotiations.
neutral	The inflation target was expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019.
dovish	 A motion to lower the NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed.
hawkish	Several members agreed that the improvement in the global growth outlook pointed to a possible increase in the risk of imported inflation through a faster-than-expected rise in oil and commodity prices.
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would approach the target from below.
hawkish	The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage had led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages.
dovish	The ensuing downside risks to domestic inflation might materialise through both import prices and contractionary effects exerted on the cyclical position of the Romanian economy in the medium run.
dovish	They also stressed that GDP growth falling below the growth of potential output in the coming quarters would contribute to curbing the inflationary pressure.
hawkish	The opinion was also expressed, however, that the risks to inflation were skewed slightly to the upside overall.
hawkish	Some members, however, were of the view that households had responded to the economic recession in part by reining back consumption spending and that latent inflationary pressures might arise once consumption picked up as the economy gradually recovered.
neutral	In the absence of the measure on broadening the scope of the reduced VAT rate, the annual inflation rate would have neared 2 percent at year-end, standing inside the ñ1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent target.
hawkish	The CDS spread, foreign currency bond spreads and long-term yields had declined.
neutral	Referring to inflation developments, some members of the Council pointed out that according to the available forecasts, inflation was running close to the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy horizon.
neutral	It was also argued that the recent interest rate decision by the European Central Bank had no influence on Hungarian monetary policy, given that it, and its communication, had not changed market participants? expectations and had been in line with the projection in the Report.
dovish	 It was also emphasised that in February inflation was significantly below expectations.
hawkish	The evolution of the adjusted CORE2 inflation was deemed to reflect stronger demand-pull and cost-push inflationary pressures, in the context of the economy?s advanced cyclical position and tight labour market conditions. 
neutral	The larger banks were now tending to lend more, but the credit volumes issued via smaller banks were still falling.
neutral	In the context of the long period of low interest rates, the value of the equilibrium real interest rate for the Czech economy was also discussed.
hawkish	The opinion was also expressed that given low interest rates, demand for loans might rise significantly once the recession subsides, causing inflation to go up.
dovish	It was said repeatedly in this regard that the undershooting of the inflation target and the further accumulation of anti-inflationary risks in the domestic economy reflected insufficient monetary easing in past quarters.
hawkish	Some Council members pointed out that 2007 Q2 brought acceleration in the pace of wage growth in enterprises, which remained higher than labour productivity growth leading to growth in unit labour costs in this sector.
neutral	The Council kept the interest rates unchanged: the reference rate at 4.25%, the lombard rate at 5.75%, the deposit rate at 2.75% and the rediscount rate at 4.50%.
dovish	Members? judged that the prospects for growth had not improved materially compared with previous months and that the domestic macroeconomic environment was basically supportive of disinflation.
neutral	Members had differing views about how the depreciation of the forint would affect inflation.
neutral	The Board agreed that monetary policy decision-making was difficult, because both upside and downside risks to inflation in relation to the February forecast could be identified.
neutral	The Council judged that ? given the available information ? in the coming years inflation would run close to the inflation target.
hawkish	Wage growth stayed above labor productivity dynamics.
dovish	The external environment and also the current settings of the monetary conditions were included among the downside risks.
neutral	Several members noted that financial market conditions were stable and might remain supportive in the period ahead, due to the accommodative policy by developed country central banks.
dovish	As a consequence, the three-month BUBOR had remained at a historically low level.
