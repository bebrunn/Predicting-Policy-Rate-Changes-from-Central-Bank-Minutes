dovish	The inflation pressures would ease in the period ahead owing to rising labour productivity growth and a renewed anti-inflationary effect of import prices.
hawkish	Those members assessed that labour market data signalled building-up inflationary pressure in the Polish economy. 
hawkish	On the other hand, private consumption growth ? the driving force behind last year?s step-up in GDP dynamics to 4.8 percent ? had climbed to a nine-year high of 7.3 percent, mainly on account of higher real disposable income.
dovish	Based on the projection in the June Inflation Report, Hungarian economic performance in 2020 was likely to be more subdued than earlier expected, while the outlook for inflation had shifted downwards persistently.
dovish	Some of the board members expressed concerns about potential persistence of the adverse consequences of the mortgage crisis for the financial sector and about a possible future slowdown in euro area growth.
hawkish	Other Council members, however, assessed that the potential costs of delaying the interest rate rise outweighed possible benefits related to postponing the decision to change monetary policy parameters.
hawkish	Employment and the share of unemployed persons were both doing better than forecasted.
dovish	They also argued that amidst weakening external and domestic demand, falling demand for labour would cause faster that accounted for in the February inflation projection decline in wage growth which would be conducive to a reduction of growth in unit labour costs.
hawkish	Based on the incoming data, Hungarian GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 had significantly exceeded the MNB?s March projection and market expectations as well.
hawkish	Workforce shortages could therefore increase pressures on inflation.
hawkish	Higher-than-expected and sustained increases in commodity prices were rapidly being incorporated into consumer prices in a buoyant domestic demand environment, leading to rising inflation in general.
dovish	Most major emerging market economies were decelerating.
hawkish	Some Council members argued that, apart from high wage growth, domestic demand may be additionally driven by growth in credit aggregates, including consumption loans granted to households, which continued at a high level. 
dovish	It was also argued that the drop in the value of households? assets being the result of the downturn in the financial markets might additionally dampen the consumption growth.
neutral	Against that background, Board members underlined again the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix to avoid the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in the economy. 
neutral	In assessing inflation developments, Council members agreed that as a result of coronavirus, pricing decisions in recent months had been characterised by greater uncertainty.
dovish	The ensuing downside risks to domestic inflation might materialise through both import prices and contractionary effects exerted on the cyclical position of the Romanian economy in the medium run.
dovish	It was argued that if the economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy fell short of previous expectations, then lower growth of Polish exports should be expected and, consequently, also lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressure.
neutral	However, they emphasised that developments in the interest rate path are influenced by a number of factors which are external from the aspect of monetary policy, thus the present interest rate step does not mean any commitment with regard to future interest rate decisions.
hawkish	Some Council members assessed that the persistently high growth in lending will support strong increase in private consumption, and consequently, in aggregate demand and inflation.
neutral	One member commented that price stability has already been achieved and inflation over the forecast horizon is expected to be in line with the inflation target set out based on the MNB Act. 
dovish	Import prices were depressing inflation.
dovish	Successful disinflation also required that the wage agreements for 2008 be aligned with the expected decline in inflation. 
neutral	If the assumptions underlying the Bank?s projections held, the current level of the base rate and maintaining loose monetary conditions for an extended period, over the entire forecast horizon, were consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.
hawkish	Board members also noted the influences arising from the dynamics of some international agri-food commodity prices and from the relative weakening of the leu versus the euro, as well as from the likely indirect effects of the increases in the oil price and the prices of some utilities, inter alia in the context in which short-term inflation expectations had been more firmly adjusted upwards in the course of Q4.
hawkish	The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy were strong, and convergence to developed economies continued. 
dovish	It was also pointed out that the monetary policy in some countries of the region had been further eased in the recent period.
dovish	While addressing domestic economic activity in early 2013, it was indicated that GDP growth in the first quarter was significantly weaker than expected. 
dovish	The inflation outlook reveals a slowdown trend in the year-on-year inflation rate.
hawkish	Nevertheless, the risk of a prolonged deviation of inflation from the target through part of 2008 tends to diminish the favourable impact of this consolidation and to affect the inflation expectations of corporates and households.
neutral	"In view of the above factors, it was recommended to remain cautious, abstain from the decision to change interest rates at the August meeting and adopt a ""wait and see"" approach, following the example of some other central banks."
neutral	The regular board meeting was devoted exceptionally to, among other things, a discussion of monetary policy issues.
neutral	The majority of members judged inflation risks to be symmetrical, and therefore felt that a decision to change the policy stance was not warranted.
dovish	The return of inflation to a downward path reflects tighter broad monetary conditions, a favourable base effect, as well as lower prices of fuel and some food products and cheaper telephony rates.
hawkish	The Czech economy was above its potential output level amid accelerating economic growth.
dovish	Overall, most Monetary Council members shared the view that the favourable developments in inflation, labour market developments indicating decreasing risks of inflation and the decline in the risk premium allow a cautious interest rate cut.
neutral	In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the current meeting.
hawkish	To facilitate a decision, PÂ‚ter Bihari supported an increase of 25 basis points in interest rates.
hawkish	It was also said, however, that temporarily increased nominal unit wage costs can also be a sign that businesses are gearing up for a further strengthening of demand, and the opinion was expressed that faster-growing wages can be natural for a converging economy.
neutral	Such a monetary policy configuration is further aimed at achieving the objective of ensuring medium-term price stability while preserving financial stability and cushioning the adverse impact of domestic and external factors on the recovery of the Romanian economy.
neutral	International reserves remain adequate and Romania?s external position is sustainable.
neutral	Hungarian economic output was close to its potential level.
neutral	The larger banks were now tending to lend more, but the credit volumes issued via smaller banks were still falling.
neutral	The Council discussed the conditions to be fulfilled for Poland to join the euro area.
dovish	Based on the votes cast, the Monetary Council decided to cut the central bank base rate by 25 basis points to 7.75%. 
neutral	In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target, the Council also considered the condition of the real economy and incorporated financial stability aspects into its decisions.
neutral	At the same time, the deepening of the financial crisis on global markets has triggered uncertainties surrounding the world economic outlook and the implications on the Romanian economy.
hawkish	The main driver of economic growth is steadily increasing consumer demand, supported by gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment.
dovish	The economy was below its potential and was not emerging from the trough of the business cycle, and domestic demand was depressed.
neutral	It was also discussed whether the observed GDP growth figures, and above all the private consumption data, were low given the labour market developments, sentiment in the economy, residential housing market developments and growth in tax receipts. 
hawkish	The inflationary factors had included published data on higher household consumption and slightly faster wage growth, a higher outlook for food price inflation and a higher outlook for regulated price inflation due to an expected increase in electricity prices.
dovish	While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the signs of stronger and faster than expected slowdown in the global and Polish economic activity combined with further decline in inflationary pressure spoke of lowering the NBP interest rates.
dovish	In addition to high prices of commodities and energy, these pressures reflected persisting problems in global production chains.
hawkish	The possibility of an increase in inflation expectations, a slightly weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the euro and higher commodity prices (especially oil prices) were identified as upside risks to inflation. 
hawkish	Inflation had picked up in September, largely reflecting rises in food and fuel prices. 
dovish	Monthly increases in consumer prices in February and March 2013 stood at historically low levels, reflecting the reduction in inflation expectations.
neutral	The meeting opened with a presentation of the April situation report and the new forecast for inflation and economic developments.
hawkish	The analysis of the most recent statistical data reveals a continued high dynamics of domestic demand as investments picked up and consumption remained at an unsustainable level in the context of a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector, especially foreign currency loans.
hawkish	The most recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show the persistence of high dynamics of economic growth and productivity underpinned by investment and consumption expansion, the latter also triggering a widening of the current account deficit.
neutral	Overall, the Board agreed that wage growth seemed to be a two-sided risk.
neutral	The majority of the Council members judged that in the light of current information inflation in the next two years would be running close to the inflation target.
hawkish	Others also emphasised that inflationary pressures in Europe could be expected to pick up.
neutral	Some Council members assessed that the economic growth could stay close to previous quarters.
dovish	Delivering price stability in the medium term pointed in the direction of monetary easing. 
hawkish	The tight labour market, coupled with strong wage growth and a higher inflation environment, might lead to increases in inflation expectations and strengthen second-round inflation risks.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the significant reductions in interest rates so far and the volatile conditions in financial markets might justify changing the pace or extent of policy easing in the coming months.
neutral	In the Council?s view, the current interest rate decision was consistent with the Bank?s past behaviour and previous communication as well as with market expectations, and therefore it strengthened the Bank's credibility and predictability. 
hawkish	Several members stressed that energy prices had reached new historical highs recently and the moderation in food price inflation had been weaker than expected.
hawkish	It was said that this recovery might speed up the recovery in Czech exports and growth in European consumer prices and foreign interest rates relative to the new forecast. 
neutral	It was added that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in the long run. 
neutral	Monetary policy had thus helped inflation to step back from the edge of deflation, the threat of which, in the light of developments abroad, had been even greater than suggested by the analyses available a year ago. 
dovish	The GDP remains below potential owing to the evolution of its quarterly growth rate.
neutral	The majority of members took the view that economic performance had been broadly in line with the May projection and there had been little change in the outlook for inflation.
neutral	According to the February forecast, both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation would be close to the inflation target at the monetary policy horizon.
dovish	By contrast, the indicators of the domestic real economy were generally anti-inflationary: annual GDP growth had been 0.7 percentage points lower than forecasted, the decline in total employment had increased, and wage growth had been lower than expected.
dovish	The overall risks of the forecast were assessed as being slightly on the downside, with the principal upside and downside risks diverging to either side rather significantly.
hawkish	This was because the economy had been operating above its potential output level for some time and would continue to do so according to the outlook.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate picked up in September 2012.
hawkish	Economic activity will still be supported by stable consumption growth, accompanied with a further rise in investment growth rate.
neutral	At the meeting, members of the Council discussed the usefulness of the so-called Taylor rule in monetary policy.
dovish	They also stressed that GDP growth falling below the growth of potential output in the coming quarters would contribute to curbing the inflationary pressure.
neutral	The multitude of uncertainties and the absence of insight on the concrete measures and the implementation calendar made it impossible as yet to assess the potential macroeconomic and structural effects.
hawkish	Market expectations on both the ECB?s and the Fed?s interest rate path had shifted up.
dovish	Overall, moderate underlying inflation developments continued to point in the direction of a low inflation environment.
hawkish	However, the Czech economy was still operating above its potential, while the positive output gap was gradually closing.
dovish	The recent correction in the commodity markets was identified as a downside risk to inflation, as commodity prices might stabilise at lower levels than assumed by the forecast.
hawkish	Some members thought that despite the correction in June, the extent of the pick-up in wage growth posed an upside risk to inflation.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic indicators points to further disinflation, as a result of the decline in volatile prices, particularly food prices, as well as of the persistent negative output gap and the significant improvement in inflation expectations.
neutral	Members had differing views about how the depreciation of the forint would affect inflation.
dovish	Based on the inflation data for June, consumer prices continued to show historically low dynamics.
dovish	Prices of food and fuels had declined as a result of persisting anti-inflationary supply shocks from abroad
hawkish	Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the gradual improvement in economic conditions was likely to continue over the coming quarters, while inflation pressure would remain limited.
neutral	The Board agreed that the external economy was a source of even greater uncertainty than the domestic economy.
hawkish	In a debate on the newly published GDP figures it was said that the rapid economic growth was continuing, and the view was presented that a further increase in domestic demand growth could be expected.
neutral	However, these Council members indicated that, in light of the data available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.
neutral	The monetary conditions were broadly neutral overall.
hawkish	Continued strong growth in labour demand had led to an upswing in employment growth and a further fall in the unemployment rate, neither of which the forecast had expected. 
neutral	Over the long term, prospects for convergence with the euro area remained plausible, assuming larger capital stock and infrastructure development.
hawkish	It was said that year-on-year average nominal wage growth in the business sector was surprisingly high given the low economic activity. 
dovish	 The Board agreed that the risks and uncertainties were currently extremely high and that the majority of them would come from abroad, owing mainly to the escalation of the debt crisis in the euro area.
hawkish	The strong expansion in household consumption had been the main driving force behind growth. 
hawkish	Board members remarked that the latest economic developments indicated a slight pick-up in quarterly GDP dynamics in 2016 Q4, implying the resumed growth of excess aggregate demand and of the ensuing inflationary pressures.
hawkish	They pointed out that, in the medium term, inflation running above the inflation target would result in Polish economy gradually losing its price competitiveness.
hawkish	Annual GDP growth had accelerated significantly further to 4.7% in 2017 Q2 and was distinctly above the forecast. 
neutral	Nine members voted to maintain the base rate and four members voted for a 25 basis point increase.
neutral	Some of the board members expressed the view that the economic recovery was unbalanced not only abroad, but also in the domestic economy, and that it was being driven predominantly by exporters.
dovish	It was emphasized that reduction in lending has a negative impact on economic activity in Poland.
dovish	It was mentioned that the outlook for external demand was deteriorating significantly and the effects of the financial crisis would undoubtedly also appear in Europe.
dovish	The majority of the Council members stressed that amidst declining inflationary pressure, monetary policy should focus more on counteracting excessive slowdown of economic growth, thus contributing to maintaining price stability in the medium term.
neutral	At the forecast horizon inflation would be falling towards the inflation target after the unwinding of the effect of the tax and price shocks that occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, thanks to the anti-inflationary effect of the current appreciation of the koruna and a gradual decline in inflation pressures from the domestic economy.
dovish	Accompanied by constrained credit supply, household saving might remain high, which might act as a brake on inflation on the demand side.
hawkish	In their analysis, Board members pointed out the major role that supply-side factors continued to play in the configuration of the upward path of the forecasted annual inflation rate, especially over the short time horizon.
hawkish	Sustained rises in commodity prices and international freight costs pointed to a higher external inflation environment.
dovish	Yet, some Council members pointed out that the data on industrial output in December 2009 fell significantly short of expectations. 
hawkish	A slower-than-expected wage decline in industry and construction was mentioned as a risk of higher inflation in the future. 
neutral	It was also said several times that it was good idea to wait for more data to confirm positive tendencies in the economy.
neutral	While discussing business conditions in Poland's external environment, Council members pointed out that global activity growth remained moderate and varied considerably across the regions.
dovish	As a consequence, the three-month BUBOR had remained at a historically low level.
neutral	It was said that in an economy where inflation had long been close to the inflation target, inflation expectations were well anchored. 
hawkish	The appropriate response should therefore be to raise rates already at the present meeting.
dovish	The decline in demand, coupled with the more persistent effect of fiscal adjustment measures than earlier thought, could contribute to the disinflation process continuing.
dovish	As expected, annual growth of the Czech economy had slowed to 1.5% in 2014 Q4.
neutral	Developments in the Bank?s measures of underlying inflation had remained stable, in line with expectations.
neutral	The 2009 target, also assumed by the government, is in line with the need to achieve a sustainable medium-term inflation rate in the context of the ongoing convergence with the European Union - a process that requires sustained financial and economic efforts underpinned by an adequate macroeconomic policy mix.
neutral	In connection with the timing of the exit, the board members discussed the robustness of the current inflation trend.
hawkish	At their November policy meeting, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve had decided to start phasing out the asset purchase programme.
dovish	It was said that the decline in net exports was also hardly a signal of sustained domestic economic recovery. 
hawkish	Board members then analysed, also from the perspective of monetary transmission, the pronounced uptrend in interbank money market rates towards end-Q3, noting that it had partly stemmed from the upward revision of inflation expectations and the stronger expectations on the adjustment of the monetary policy stance, inter alia in light of international financial market developments.
hawkish	It was said that the rapid rise in wages and the forecast for further wage growth were signalling the emergence of the first inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
hawkish	Inflation was likely to be above target this year and the next, which underscored the need for further monetary tightening.
dovish	This development was further underpinned by fundamentals, namely the persistence of the negative output gap and the maintenance of inflation expectations inside the variation band of the target.
hawkish	They also emphasised that the high growth in investments and restructuring taking place in enterprises were contributing to the growth of potential GDP, which would be easing inflationary pressure.
hawkish	The Board also discussed the domestic inflation forecast, which saw inflation rising towards the upper boundary of the tolerance band in the next few quarters.
neutral	Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate.
dovish	As regards inflation expectations, it was said that a decrease could be expected. 
hawkish	Council members agreed that upside risks to inflation had picked up further recently, driven by the acceleration of imported inflation on the back of rises in food and energy prices, as well as the expected increase in administered prices.
neutral	In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as trends in the international financial markets was considered.
neutral	The Board discussed the January situation report containing the new forecast for inflation and other macroeconomic indicators.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows that the annual dynamics of indicators relevant for the trends in the domestic demand stayed in the negative territory.
dovish	A slump in production capacity utilisation would imply a need to adapt to the new market conditions in the Czech economy and abroad. 
neutral	The evolution of oil prices was a significant source of uncertainty in both directions.
hawkish	External inflationary environment was rising due to sharp increases in global commodity prices and international freight costs.
hawkish	Turning to economic growth, the annual GDP dynamics picked up in 2013 Q1 on the back of net exports, whose upturn entailed a marked advance in manufacturing output.
neutral	There were both upside and downside risks to developments in investment, and consequently to the future path of the economy?s potential output.
dovish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that December data on industrial output and retail sales were significantly below expectations.
dovish	Market optimism had deteriorated in the past two weeks. 
hawkish	It was noted that activity growth in 2018 Q4 had continued to be driven by consumption, which had been rising further ? albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous quarters ? fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very strong consumer sentiment.
hawkish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth, most members of the Council assessed that GDP growth in the coming quarters would gradually accelerate with consumption and investment remaining its key drivers.
dovish	When discussing the situation in the financial markets, it was pointed out that growing concerns about the global economic activity had boosted investor expectations of further monetary policy easing by major central banks.
dovish	In May 2017, inflation had eased to 2.1 percent.
hawkish	Economic growth - supported by a solid rise in investment and, to a lesser extent, by an advance in consumption - has remained fast at 7.7 percent, while the persistence of excess demand has triggered a wider current account deficit.
dovish	This projects a decline in cost-side inflationary pressure.
hawkish	The NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 7.0 percent
hawkish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows a continued fast increase in exports, also reflected in import flows, along with a sustained industrial output dynamics.
dovish	The Board discussed the causes of the lower-than-forecasted household consumption growth in detail.
dovish	As a consequence, appetite for risk in emerging markets had deteriorated.
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would approach the target from below.
neutral	In line with the Bank?s expectations, there had not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages.
neutral	The NBR will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings to counteract inflationary pressures in order to resume the assumed disinflation trajectory and achieve medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic and financial indicators shows a significant slowdown of economic growth against the background of deepening of the global crisis as well as the ongoing, rapid adjustment of the external imbalance, which however has yet to reach sustainable longer-term levels.
neutral	The risks related mainly to factors outside the central bank's influence ? administered price adjustments, consistent continuation of the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as well as future developments in external agri-food and commodity prices as well those arising from the international economic environment - require a further prudent monetary policy stance.
neutral	However, members held the unanimous view that monetary policy should closely monitor potential pass-through into the consumer price index.
neutral	According to information currently available, the inflation target could be met in 2008.
dovish	In the opinion of some Council members, a significant downward revision of the January inflation, together with markedly lower than expected inflation in February, allowed to assume that inflation might return within the limit for deviations from the NBP?s inflation target sooner than accounted for in the February inflation projection. 
hawkish	In parallel with strong wage growth expected to continue this year, household consumption was likely to grow dynamically, which would be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years as well.
dovish	Overall, sentiment in international financial markets had rather deteriorated since the Council?s previous interest rate decision.
dovish	In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 8.0 percent.
hawkish	While referring to the labour market situation, it was pointed out that the number of the employed in the economy increased in 2010 Q2 and employment in the enterprise sector continued to rise gradually in Q3.
neutral	On the other hand, few members of the Council indicated that considering the NBP?s March projection of inflation and its balance of risks, in mid-2013 inflation should come close to the target.
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and the inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period.
dovish	Some Council members thought that in parallel with the appreciation of the real exchange rate, economic prospects had further deteriorated in the previous period due to decreased export demand and increased import competition, which may lead to higher unemployment.
dovish	Considering the first half of 2020 as a whole, the Hungarian economy had exhibited a similar decline to that seen in other countries in the region.
neutral	In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 7.0 percent per annum
neutral	Members voted unanimously in favour of maintaining the base rate at 2.10 per cent.
hawkish	The need to effectively anchor inflation expectations by avoiding their additional worsening against the background of global market tensions requires the continuation of monetary policy restrictiveness with an appropriate dosage of its instruments, while also calling for stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix.
hawkish	 Renewed growth in investment would foster higher economic growth.
neutral	It was said repeatedly during the meeting that the new forecast provided a credible and consistent story. 
neutral	The opinion was expressed that the economic crisis had not affected the long-run rate of growth of potential output. 
neutral	The opinion was expressed that it should not, as the asset price growth may be just a consequence of rapidly rising wealth coupled with limited investment opportunities.
hawkish	Looking ahead, whole-economy wage growth was likely to rise further, as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the latest wage agreement.
