dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic indicators developments reveals a consolidation of disinflation with a certain lag, a persistent economic contraction and an ongoing significant adjustment of the external deficit, along with a worsening of foreign investors? perception regarding the Romanian economy amid heightened tensions in the domestic political field.
hawkish	They also pointed to the relatively high level of production capacity utilisation, which should translate into revival of enterprises? investment demand, particularly considering their very good financial situation.
neutral	In the Council?s assessment, the assumptions underlying the September Inflation Report had continued to hold.
neutral	In June 2016 the annual inflation rate had remained unchanged.
dovish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that in May the growth of industrial output was markedly lower than expected, which had been previously signalled by business sentiment indicators.
hawkish	Rising exports were likely to play a role as a source of growth, supported among other factors by an increase in market share due to the establishment of new production capacities in the automobile industry, in addition to the recovery in external activity.
hawkish	The opinion was expressed that some improvement had occurred since the autumn, when the markets had been frozen. 
neutral	A few Council members indicated that considering the already implemented monetary policy easing as well as expected gradual improvement in business conditions in the second half of 2013, the current cycle of NBP interest rate cuts might be approaching a pause or an end.
hawkish	There was a consensus that global cost pressures were a significant source of the domestic price growth. 
dovish	Several members noted that there had been further deceleration in global economic activity and, therefore, external demand was unlikely to contribute to a pick-up in domestic economic growth.
neutral	After the presentation of the April situation report, the Board discussed the new forecast.
dovish	The decline in demand, coupled with the more persistent effect of fiscal adjustment measures than earlier thought, could contribute to the disinflation process continuing.
dovish	Some Council members emphasised that, in the face of the deteriorating situation in international financial markets and the dampening prospect of economic growth, major central banks were expected to ease their monetary policy.
hawkish	The adjusted monetary policy stance should ensure a firm and sustainable anchoring of inflation expectations at low levels, in order to limit the temporary rise of aggregate prices and bring annual price growth as fast as possible within the medium-term disinflation trajectory agreed with the government.
hawkish	According to some indicators, inflation expectations had started to creep up. 
neutral	It was said several times that in the current situation it was appropriate to wait and see whether inflationary tendencies materialised in the domestic economy.
neutral	In the Council?s assessment, in the conditions of increased uncertainty associated with the turmoil in international financial markets, the balance of risks for future inflation pointed to the necessity of a monetary policy tightening.
neutral	Nonetheless, a majority of the board members agreed that the slowdown in industrial production growth and the drop in exports were temporary.
dovish	Inflation expectations had fallen to a historic low.
hawkish	In addition, inflation could peak at a higher level in 2007 due to greater-than-expected increases in administered prices earlier in the year, which might also contribute to a rise in inflation expectations and a build-up of inflationary pressure. 
hawkish	Most of the newly available data on the domestic economy were assessed as representing upside risks to inflation
hawkish	Some of the board members expressed the opinion that the unexpectedly higher growth in household consumption could represent an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	In parallel with strong wage growth expected to continue this year, household consumption was likely to grow dynamically, which would be supported by the realisation of consumption deferred from previous years as well.
dovish	On another argument, however, core inflation was lower than the path outlined in the November projection, due to the slower pass-through of the unprocessed food price shock, which was positive news in terms of the longer-term outlook for inflation.
hawkish	Furthermore, it was shown that fundamentals were expected to exert somewhat stronger-than-previously-anticipated inflationary pressures, and relatively steady over the projection horizon, given the forecasts on the cyclical position of the economy, wage costs, as well as import price dynamics.
dovish	In May 2017, inflation had eased to 2.1 percent.
hawkish	At 4% in October, annual consumer price inflation had been 0.2 percentage points higher than predicted by the October forecast.
hawkish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the new inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being slightly inflationary.
neutral	The monetary policy remained prudent, seeking to anchor inflation expectations and pave the way for the annual inflation rate to near the medium-term target.
hawkish	The Board also discussed the domestic inflation forecast, which saw inflation rising towards the upper boundary of the tolerance band in the next few quarters.
neutral	The consumer price index was likely to rise temporarily in the coming months, before easing back to around current levels by the end of the year.
neutral	The prevailing view was that negative rates were not an appropriate tool for easing monetary conditions and hence for influencing inflation directly at the monetary policy horizon.
neutral	Looking ahead, economic growth might continue in a more balanced pattern than previously, with the recovery in domestic demand likely to make a larger contribution.
dovish	Due to the increasingly stronger restrictions introduced, the economic recovery was expected to be delayed.
neutral	The NBR Board has also decided to keep unchanged the current levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on liabilities of credit institutions.
hawkish	The domestic economy was on a growth path.
dovish	In this context, the deepening recession in the United States and in the euro area was pointed out together with a risk of further downward revisions of economic growth forecasts for Poland?s main trading partners.
hawkish	As regards domestic price developments, there was a consensus that the economy was facing inflation pressures stemming from the positive output gap and the tight labour market.
dovish	Looking ahead, a pick-up in external demand was unlikely to be a driver of economic recovery over the medium term, due to the deterioration in the outlook for business activity in Europe and at the international level.
dovish	The Board discussed the current evolution of the exchange rate and agreed that its present level was strongly anti-inflationary compared to the forecast.
hawkish	At the same time, however, Board members voiced concern over the risk that the strong inflation bout driven by supply-side shocks might trigger significant side effects via the worsening of medium-term inflation expectations and implicitly compound the efforts and costs of bringing inflation back under control, especially amid growing pressures from fundamentals. 
neutral	In the Monetary Council?s assessment, a cautious approach to monetary policy was still warranted.
dovish	Based on the inflation data for December, consumer prices showed historically low dynamics.
neutral	The Magyar Nemzeti Bank takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the horizon of monetary policy.
neutral	At the same time, it stated that there were two bidirectional uncertainties of the forecast. 
dovish	The decisions convey a positive signal to the banking system, the business community and households, by prompting a gradually downward trend in domestic currency lending costs and fostering economic activity.
dovish	While discussing the economic developments in Poland, Council members indicated that in 2013 Q1 economic activity had remained weak without signs of recovery.
dovish	Compared to the previous macroeconomic forecast from October last year, expected inflation and forecast-consistent interest rates had been revised downwards. 
neutral	It was also said that it was unclear whether wages would act in the inflationary or anti-inflationary direction.
neutral	In this context, some Council members pointed to the need to appropriately coordinate the fiscal and monetary policies in the period preceding Poland?s accession to the euro area.
dovish	The amount of the Hungarian Government Security Plus purchased had continued to be considerable, more than half of which had been registered as a new source of financing for the government sector.
dovish	Risks in this direction stemmed mainly from inflation, which had decreased faster at the start of this year than the CNB had expected.
neutral	The Council paid considerable attention to the prospects of economic growth.
hawkish	The positive turnaround in sentiment reflected the release of favourable macroeconomic data in the US.
dovish	The statistical data suggest a near stalemate in economic activity in 2012 from the previous year amid a drought-induced drop in agricultural production and protracted euro area recession, which hurt Romania?s net exports and industrial output.
dovish	At the same time, some members of the Council pointed out that rising unemployment might, due to the hysteresis effect, negatively affect the potential GDP growth in the coming period.
hawkish	The existence of a positive output gap and a further gradual widening of that gap this year, along with expectations regarding external economic developments and the effect of fiscal policy, had led to the economic growth forecast being increased above 6% for 2007. 
neutral	In today?s meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which reiterates the outlook for the annual inflation rate to run over the medium term inside the variation band of the target, i.e. ñ1 percentage point around the 2.5 percent multiannual flat target, starting in the latter half of 2014. 
hawkish	The Board agreed that the situation as regards inflation, the labour market, the phase of the business cycle and other macroeconomic parameters fully justified raising interest rates.
hawkish	Other members of the Council emphasised that GDP is still rising faster than potential output, leading to a widening of the output gap and a rise in inflationary pressure.
neutral	The NBR Board has decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.
neutral	At its meeting the Council also discussed developments in monetary and credit aggregates.
neutral	In the autumn months, inflation had been basically in line with the September Inflation Report projection.
neutral	At end-2015, foreign exchange reserves amounted to EUR 32 billion, similarly to the level recorded a year before, after making payments on public and publicly-guaranteed external debt service of about EUR 7.2 billion. 
dovish	The exchange rate, which had, on average, appreciated more markedly than forecasted during the third quarter, was also acting in a slightly anti-inflationary directio
hawkish	According to few Council members, an additional risk to inflation in the short term is the likely rise in prices of services and fees that are at the discretion of local government units.
dovish	Repayment burdens prompted households to adjust their balance sheets and, as a result, a further decline in domestic purchasing power could not be ruled out over the short term.
dovish	The latest assessments reconfirm the prospects for the annual inflation rate to remain subdued over the months ahead, in the vicinity of historical lows.
neutral	The opinion was expressed that it should not, as the asset price growth may be just a consequence of rapidly rising wealth coupled with limited investment opportunities.
hawkish	The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy were strong, and convergence to developed economies continued. 
hawkish	Meanwhile, the leu strengthened versus the euro due to an improved perception of foreign investors towards the Romanian economy.
neutral	The majority of Council members judged that, due to the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices which had a strong impact on the outlook for inflation, monetary policy should take a wait-and-see stance, leaving open the possibility of changing interest rates either up or down.
hawkish	It was said repeatedly that the higher wage growth, disposable income and consumption were generating appropriate inflation pressures.
hawkish	While addressing bank lending, some members of the Council pointed out that monthly increases in housing loans to households were close to the ones observed during the credit boom of 2007-2008, and the annual growth in those loans markedly exceeded disposable income growth considered neutral with respect to the risk of rising inflation.
neutral	There was a consensus that the appropriate response was to leave monetary policy rates unchanged at technical zero.
neutral	Several members noted that the effects of the various adverse shocks to consumer prices could reinforce each other. 
neutral	The monetary policy priority was to hit the inflation target at the forecast horizon, and that was not currently in any danger. 
dovish	The Board agreed that the external environment in particular was a source of sizeable anti-inflationary shocks.
dovish	The board members agreed that a worse course of the pandemic, longer lockdowns at home and abroad and an ensuing deterioration in the financial situation and sentiment of businesses and households were the main risk to the forecast.
dovish	The risk of a permanent increase in inflation expectations decreased considerably. 
neutral	It was also repeatedly said that the economy was in a situation of full employment and was close to its potential output level.
dovish	The unemployment rate was falling, but still exceeded its long-term level determined by structural factors.
hawkish	Vojtech Benda said that the economy had moved appreciably in the inflationary direction since the last meeting.
dovish	The majority of the Council members stressed that amidst declining inflationary pressure, monetary policy should focus more on counteracting excessive slowdown of economic growth, thus contributing to maintaining price stability in the medium term.
neutral	In the Council?s assessment, in the medium term the probability of inflation running above the inflation target had decreased to a certain degree due to the previously implemented monetary policy tightening and thus it was not necessary to change the interest rates at that meeting.
hawkish	The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to pick up in June.
dovish	In the Monetary Council?s assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end supported price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner.
dovish	According the new forecast a modest slowdown in economic growth and persisting low monetary policy inflation (i.e. consumer price inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of indirect taxes) could be expected. 
dovish	The volume of world trade was declining, which, combined with the announcements of further measures to increase trade barriers was reflected in the persistently weak performance of the industrial sector.
hawkish	This was because the economy had been operating above its potential output level for some time and would continue to do so according to the outlook.
dovish	Several Council members noted that they perceived continued downside risks to external inflation, particularly in the euro area, which could provide room for further cautious easing of policy.
neutral	The NBR Board has also decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions
dovish	The Bank aimed to ease monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through a decline in money market rates.
neutral	Members were unanimous in concluding that the baseline projection in the Report, which assumed that the current 6% level of official interest rates might ensure that inflation would come back to the 3% target in 2012 H2, should be taken as the starting point for a policy decision this month.
hawkish	At the same time, these members pointed out that the high growth of broad money supply observed for the last several years might indicate the persistence of inflationary pressure in the economy.
dovish	Other members argued that the decline of GDP growth in the coming quarters below the potential output growth would bring inflation down to the target in the medium term, while pointing out that the weakening of the economic activity in Poland might prove stronger than currently assessed which, coupled with the limited credit availability and market interest rates remaining at an increased level due to the turmoil in the international financial markets, might contribute to bringing down inflation below the target.
neutral	However, they emphasised that developments in the interest rate path are influenced by a number of factors which are external from the aspect of monetary policy, thus the present interest rate step does not mean any commitment with regard to future interest rate decisions.
hawkish	Inflation in the euro area and the US had risen since the beginning of the year.
dovish	While discussing the decision on interest rates, the Council assessed that the signs of stronger and faster than expected slowdown in the global and Polish economic activity combined with further decline in inflationary pressure spoke of lowering the NBP interest rates.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the significant reductions in interest rates so far and the volatile conditions in financial markets might justify changing the pace or extent of policy easing in the coming months.
neutral	Considering the various interest rate policy options, arguments for raising or maintaining the central bank base rate were largely in balance.
dovish	The productive capacity of the economy continued to be lower than optimal, with the output gap remaining negative.
hawkish	Both developments had potentially negative implications for inflation expectations, as the output gap might be smaller, which might entail more modest disinflationary effects.
hawkish	Another upside risk to inflation mentioned was expected developments abroad, where the primary upside factors included a rise in interest rates in the euro area, leading to a widening of the negative interest rate differential, and also an increase in expected economic growth.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that the drop in oil prices was a positive supply shock.
hawkish	Other Council members, however, assessed that the potential costs of delaying the interest rate rise outweighed possible benefits related to postponing the decision to change monetary policy parameters.
hawkish	According to Tom ? Nidetzk? and Tom ? Holub, the labour market was also generating robust inflation pressures.
neutral	Members agreed that it would be appropriate to send a signal to market participants about expected changes in the future conduct of interest rate policy.
hawkish	Those members assessed that in the conditions of the currently high production capacity utilisation, the dynamic growth of domestic demand creates a significant risk of inflation growing above the inflation target in the medium term.
neutral	In the discussion of the growth outlook for the domestic economy, it was said repeatedly that the government?s declared intention to ease its fiscal consolidation drive was relevant information.
hawkish	That, in turn, might make it difficult to anchor inflation expectations and add to the risk of second-round inflationary effects.
dovish	The Board also agreed that the appropriate response was to leave rates unchanged and to maintain them at technical zero over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly.
neutral	According to those Council members, current or forecast macroeconomic situation did not justify interest rate cuts.
dovish	While discussing the situation in the labour market, some members of the Council pointed to the persistent relatively high unemployment rate and a fall in unit labour costs in 2010 Q3 which limit the rise in wage pressure.
dovish	Weakening external activity was restraining the pace of price increase.
hawkish	The developments in core inflation reveal both the persistent excess demand and the ongoing effects of supply-side shocks.
hawkish	On the one hand, mention was made of the positive evolution of economic activity in the euro area, whose rate of growth had been rising in recent quarters.
hawkish	It was said that rising employment amid a falling number of full-time equivalent employees meant an increasing number of part-timers, which was a favourable factor.
dovish	Europe was described as being in a period of sustained low growth and burdened by numerous economic problems. 
hawkish	It was stressed that the major determinant of this core inflation pattern was the dynamics of excess aggregate demand and of its inflationary pressures, anticipated to be slacker than in the prior projection over the very short term and markedly faster thereafter, amid the relative step-up in the forecasted rate of quarterly GDP growth over the projection horizon, after the significant slowdown in 2016 H2.
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, investigates the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and constraints to monetary policy in the period ahead.
hawkish	Workforce shortages could therefore increase pressures on inflation.
hawkish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows a continued fast increase in exports, also reflected in import flows, along with a sustained industrial output dynamics.
neutral	At the same time, some Board members mentioned the need for closer correlation of economic policy decisions in order to prevent adverse effects on the real convergence process.
dovish	Members judged that domestic economic developments were worse than thought previously, and that the most important components of domestic demand had not yet shown clear signs of a turnaround.
neutral	The subsequent return to conventional monetary policy would not imply appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded before the intervention regime started. 
dovish	Annual GDP growth had been 2.2% in Q2, i.e. 0.3 percentage point lower than forecasted. Annual inflation had been 1.7% in August, i.e. 0.4 percentage point lower than forecasted.
hawkish	Inflation had risen further in 2017 Q1, entering the upper half of the tolerance band around the CNB?s target. 
neutral	In quarter-on-quarter terms, economic activity had increased in line with the forecast.
dovish	It was indicated that the ECB launched the first conditional liquidity provision operations to banks in September and announced the start of asset purchases in 2014 Q4.
dovish	The spread of the virus could again lead to a deterioration in global growth prospects and an increase in risk aversion in emerging markets.
dovish	Overall, most Monetary Council members shared the view that the favourable developments in inflation, labour market developments indicating decreasing risks of inflation and the decline in the risk premium allow a cautious interest rate cut.
hawkish	The MNB would sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate.
dovish	At the meeting, the prevailing view was that the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the medium term was higher than the probability of inflation running above the target.
hawkish	The latter was expected to witness a strong acceleration, albeit unevenly distributed over the projection horizon, with the forecasted annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate rising more slowly in 2017 than in the previous projection, yet at a faster pace in the second part of 2018.
neutral	Several members emphasised that the uncertainty concerning inflation will last as long as more accurate information concerning the trends on the labour market and inflation-related outlooks are not available, which requires a cautious interest rate policy.
neutral	The Council kept the interest rates unchanged.
hawkish	In the subsequent debate about inflation expectations, it was said that a period of high inflation and of waiting for an appreciation to materialise can lead to volatility of inflation expectations.
hawkish	Most Council members considered the current GDP growth to be higher than the potential output growth.
neutral	However, members were divided over the assessment of the latest inflation data.
neutral	However, the prevailing opinion was that inflation expectations were well anchored and that the rise in headline inflation due to the VAT changes would be only temporary, as evidenced by historical experience.
neutral	It was said several times that it would be wrong to overestimate the effect of volatile items on the inflation outlook.
dovish	Some Council members thought that in parallel with the appreciation of the real exchange rate, economic prospects had further deteriorated in the previous period due to decreased export demand and increased import competition, which may lead to higher unemployment.
hawkish	It was said that this recovery might speed up the recovery in Czech exports and growth in European consumer prices and foreign interest rates relative to the new forecast. 
hawkish	A high wage growth in enterprises can also lead to accelerated wage growth in the public sector, where only slight productivity growth was observed, which would be conducive to increased inflation.
dovish	The strong domestic inflation pressures, which had been amplified by one-off factors at the start of the year, would fade quickly.
hawkish	Moreover, the administered price increases will lead to a temporarily faster growth of annual inflation rate in July.
hawkish	In the discussion about the labour market situation, it was reasoned that high wage growth and growing unit labour costs continued to be major risk factors to inflation in the medium term.
dovish	Practically all components of GDP had been lower than forecasted.
dovish	In this context, it was mentioned that a rise in household savings accompanied by falling consumption represented a downside risk to inflation.
hawkish	A return of inflation to a downward trajectory compatible with achieving the medium-term disinflation objectives and the progress in the nominal and real convergence process requires tighter monetary policy and increased consistency of the entire economic policy mix.
dovish	In the opinion of some Council members, the risk of a global recession recurring has increased in recent weeks.
dovish	At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to lower the CNB two-week repo rate.
hawkish	The unemployment rate had been at its historical low.
hawkish	Under these circumstances, further consolidation of monetary policy restrictiveness through an appropriate dosage of its instruments is needed, as well as stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix.
dovish	It was said that risks towards a need for easier monetary conditions had already been identified when the forecast was being discussed six weeks earlier and that the new data were strengthening this need. 
dovish	The level of output would remain below its potential over the entire period.
hawkish	In addition, the negative output gap closing earlier than previously expected might also imply higher future inflation.
hawkish	It was noted that the annual inflation rate had posted a faster-than-forecasted rise during Q3 too, and that, in the absence of all changes in indirect taxes, excise duties and non-tax fees and charges, it would have stood at 2.6 percent in September, marginally above the midpoint of the flat target. 
dovish	Looking at domestic developments, statistical indicators reveal the persistence of negative output gap.
hawkish	The slightly positive inflation had been due to the return of administered prices to annual growth and to still markedly positive adjusted inflation excluding fuels. 
neutral	The new forecast was based on an assumption of flat market interest rates at their current very low level and the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument until 2015 Q3.
hawkish	At the same time, GDP growth figures for the second quarter had been revised upwards. 
hawkish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast for the rest of this year as being inflationary.
dovish	The Monetary Council would launch the FGS fix with a total amount of HUF 1,000 billion in early 2019.
hawkish	The dynamic expansion in corporate and household lending had contributed significantly to last year?s strong economic growth. 
neutral	Opinions were also expressed that increases in indirect taxes would not have to affect consumer prices to the full extent. 
neutral	The Council expected the inflation rate to remain around zero per cent on average this year, before rising gradually to levels around the medium-term target in the course of next year.
dovish	The board members agreed that the overall balance of risks to inflation was clearly on the downside and that the new information received since the previous monetary policy meeting and since the completion of the new forecast was tending towards a more significant reduction of interest rates.
neutral	The forint had appreciated against the euro.
neutral	It was said several times that the situation was little changed from the previous situation report from the economic perspective.
hawkish	The most recent data and business surveys point to an ongoing expansion of consumer demand, amid the fiscal stimuli and rising household income. 
hawkish	Nevertheless, domestic developments also pointed to a higher inflation path. 
hawkish	In the case of energy sources, the rise in prices had been extraordinarily high.
neutral	The rate of growth of the Czech economy had stayed at 2.4% in Q3.
hawkish	The growth in household consumption was generating stable inflation pressures.
dovish	Amid a broad-based sell-off, bond markets in the advanced economies had also been affected by episodes of heightened tensions and liquidity squeeze, while financial markets in emerging economies had seen substantial capital outflows. 
hawkish	Additionally, high growth in Asian economies whose demand might constitute a factor stimulating recovery in the economies being Poland?s major trading partners was stressed.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the Hungarian economy was characterised by significant unused capacity, and inflationary pressures were likely to remain moderate over the medium term.
neutral	Members judged that recent domestic activity data were in line with the central inflation projection. 
dovish	The slowdown in external demand was already reflected in domestic macroeconomic data.
hawkish	 Members agreed that CPI inflation in June and July had been higher than previously expected, as a result of higher unprocessed food prices and the increase in excise duties in the course of the year.
neutral	The consumer price index was likely to remain near its current level over the remainder of this year.
neutral	Following discussion of the latest macroeconomic news and financial market developments, the only proposition offered to the Council was to maintain interest rates. 
hawkish	Industrial production had risen again in June; and the sector?s performance was expected to be buoyant in 2017 as a whole.
neutral	The three-month, fixed-rate central bank deposit would be the Magyar Nemzeti Bank?s main policy instrument from 23 September 2015, replacing the two-week deposit facility. 
dovish	The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates.
neutral	The risks related to the outlook for inflation appeared to be balanced. 
neutral	In connection with the baseline projection in the June Report, the Monetary Council had identified three alternative scenarios which might significantly influence the future conduct of monetary policy.
hawkish	In parallel with the tightening of interest rate conditions, the Monetary Council continued to phase out the instruments having an effect at longer maturities. 
hawkish	Board members then analysed, also from the perspective of monetary transmission, the pronounced uptrend in interbank money market rates towards end-Q3, noting that it had partly stemmed from the upward revision of inflation expectations and the stronger expectations on the adjustment of the monetary policy stance, inter alia in light of international financial market developments.
neutral	The monetary conditions were broadly neutral overall.
dovish	In our region, the decision-makers at the Czech and the Polish central banks had cut the policy rates to close to zero as well.
neutral	In view of the elevated uncertainty surrounding economic and financial developments, the NBR Board also decided to suspend the previously announced calendar of monetary policy meetings and hold monetary policy meetings whenever necessary for an indefinite period.
neutral	Some members of the Council believed that available data ? including higher than expected GDP growth in 2009 Q2 and inflation remaining above the target and above the June projection ? as well as further improvement in the outlook for economic activity justified the assessment that the probabilities of inflation running above and below the inflation target in the medium term were roughly equal.
dovish	In the euro area, market expectations on the interest rate path had shifted down.
dovish	The low inflation had been due to a continuing decline in administered prices and subdued inflation in the euro area. 
hawkish	It was said several times that only the first signs of recovery were being observed and that these signs could be slightly stronger in the outturns of some indicators than had been forecasted.
neutral	There was a consensus that there was no need to change monetary policy.
neutral	Aside from the evolution of international oil and agri-food prices, developments in administered prices were also deemed relevant.
neutral	Following the review of macroeconomic information and the situation of the financial market, it was proposed that the base rate of interest should be maintained.
dovish	In the Monetary Council?s judgement, the Hungarian economy was in recession and external and domestic factors both pointed to weak growth in the period ahead.
neutral	The US Fed and the ECB had made decisions in diverging policy directions in December.
dovish	It was said that the decline in net exports was also hardly a signal of sustained domestic economic recovery. 
hawkish	While discussing the current inflation, some members of the Council also pointed out that inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target was mainly connected with the previously effected increases in regulated prices and rising unprocessed food prices.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, it was said repeatedly that the data that had been published since the last situation report did not represent significant deviations from the forecast from the perspective of inflation pressures.
hawkish	The external environment features a relative consolidation in investor confidence, as a result of measures implemented by major central banks.
hawkish	The vaccination coverage rate of Hungary?s population was at the top in the European Union, which had provided a good foundation for restarting economic life.
neutral	A majority of the board members did not regard the evolution of the labour market as a risk for inflation.
dovish	It was argued that if the economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy fell short of previous expectations, then lower growth of Polish exports should be expected and, consequently, also lower economic growth and lower inflationary pressure.
dovish	At the same time, it was assessed that subsequent quarters would see a downward trend in GDP growth which was suggested by macroeconomic data for April 2009.
hawkish	The policy stances of the world?s leading central banks had become tighter.
neutral	At the meeting, the Council also discussed current and expected inflation developments.
dovish	On the other hand, however, it was said that the lower-than-expected inflation, even though resulting from a change in the basket structure, was a downside risk of the forecast, or a risk of non-fulfilment of the inflation target.
hawkish	The risks associated with an increase in wages not being supported by sufficient progress in productivity and a possible easing of fiscal policy require the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance.
neutral	Council members were in agreement that anchoring inflation expectations continued to be a key task for monetary policy in the current environment and that 2008 wage developments would play a major role in this regard.
neutral	The majority of members present at the meeting agreed that the outlook for inflation was basically favourable, similarly to earlier months.
dovish	The broader analysis of economic developments shows a relative slowdown of economic growth, attributable to the negative supply-side shock triggered by farming sector output, with consumption remaining at unsustainable levels, as also revealed by the persistent worsening of Romania's external deficit.
dovish	Headline inflation had risen in 2009 Q4, but had remained below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the inflation target.
neutral	The average interbank money market rate has approached the monetary policy rate.
neutral	The presentation of the new macroeconomic forecast was followed by a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the forecast.
hawkish	 Upside risks to the outlook for inflation had generally increased.
hawkish	Favourable economic developments had been reflected in the fact that the international rating agencies S&P and Fitch Ratings had upgraded Hungary?s debt rating.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate will remain in the upcoming period above the upper limit of the variation band around the 2008 target.
dovish	Monetary Council members agreed that there had clearly been a reduction in investors? perceptions of risks in March, which made it possible for the Council continue the easing cycle justified by macroeconomic fundamentals.
neutral	Those Council members stated that wage growth in enterprises remained moderate, especially against the background of labour productivity growth, and was consistent with inflation stabilising at the inflation target.
dovish	The persistently low cost environment contained the increase in the consumer price index.
dovish	When discussing recent developments in the economic activity, Board members pointed out the stronger-than-forecasted slowdown in third-quarter growth ? with annual GDP dynamics decelerating to 4.4 percent from 6 percent in Q2 ?, entailing a likely halt in the advance of excess aggregate demand during that period, contrary to expectations. 
dovish	Both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation had decreased in Q4, remaining well below the lower boundary of the tolerance band around the target.
neutral	Developments in macroeconomic indicators show the evolution of inflation in line with the central bank?s forecasts.
neutral	Against that background, Board members underlined again the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix to avoid the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in the economy. 
neutral	The Board agreed that the external economy was a source of even greater uncertainty than the domestic economy.
hawkish	Growth in economic activity was also being significantly aided by an increase in investment in the private sector. 
neutral	These developments are in line with the previous forecasts of the annual inflation rate returning and subsequently remaining inside the variation band of the flat 2.5 percent target.
hawkish	At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to increase the two-week repo rate.
hawkish	While discussing the NBP interest rate policy, members of the Council agreed that the current assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation justified the continuation of monetary policy tightening in a previously assumed scale. 
hawkish	Board members remarked that the latest economic developments indicated a slight pick-up in quarterly GDP dynamics in 2016 Q4, implying the resumed growth of excess aggregate demand and of the ensuing inflationary pressures.
neutral	The prudent monetary policy stance throughout 2012 was aimed at anchoring inflation expectations via a steady dosage of the instruments available to the central bank and strengthening the prospects for the annual inflation rate to remain close to the medium-term target.
neutral	The ongoing prudent stance of the monetary policy, including an optimal dosage of the instruments available to the central bank, and the observance by the other components of the macroeconomic policy mix of the commitments agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement are essential to ensure a sustainable disinflation and fulfilment of medium-term objectives.
neutral	Several members thought that the risks to inflation had not increased in recent months, and therefore further policy tightening was not needed at the current meeting.
dovish	Balance-sheet deleveraging by economic agents would continue, with consumption and investment likely to fall further, mainly due to tight credit conditions and the uncertain business environment, followed by a gradual recovery from 2014. 
hawkish	The exchange rate of the koruna, which was weaker than forecasted, was repeatedly mentioned as the most significant inflationary factor.
neutral	Moreover, Board members underlined the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix to avoid the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in the economy; a balanced policy mix was also necessary for the orderly adjustment of the current account deficit. 
dovish	Based on the votes cast, the Monetary Council decided to cut the central bank base rate by 25 basis points to 7.75%. 
dovish	The prevailing view in the discussion was that there were anti-inflationary risks of lower economic growth abroad owing to the fiscal situation in certain indebted euro area countries. 
hawkish	However, based on the latest projections issued by international organisations, high food prices could persist for some time compared to earlier expectations, which, in turn, could have adverse effects on domestic inflation developments.
hawkish	Board members also noted the influences arising from the dynamics of some international agri-food commodity prices and from the relative weakening of the leu versus the euro, as well as from the likely indirect effects of the increases in the oil price and the prices of some utilities, inter alia in the context in which short-term inflation expectations had been more firmly adjusted upwards in the course of Q4.
dovish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that anti-inflationary factors had accumulated since the previous situation report and that no significant upside risks to inflation were apparent over the entire forecast horizon. 
neutral	The Magyar Nemzeti Bank?s single anchor is inflation.
hawkish	Against this, however, the prevailing view was that the new labour market data confirmed the forecast assumptions of an upswing in wage growth and nominal unit wage cost growth.
neutral	The external environment was marked by deteriorating prospects of global economic activity against the background of increased investor risk aversion and of the uncertainties surrounding a sustainable resolution of the euro area sovereign debt crisis.
neutral	Yields on domestic long-term government securities had not changed notably since the previous policy decision. 
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period.
neutral	It was emphasised that the share of wage costs in total costs remained at a low and stable level, which meant that enterprises would not have to increase their prices in response to wage growth acceleration.
hawkish	On the other hand, the depreciation of the average annual leu-euro exchange rate (9.3 percent in 2008 compared to the previous year) is fueling inflationary pressures.
dovish	Doubts were repeatedly expressed about whether the GDP growth forecast of 1.2% for 2011 was not too pessimistic. 
dovish	This outlook enables the gradual easing of the monetary policy stance, while effectively anchoring inflation expectations and duly monitoring domestic and global developments.
hawkish	Members preferring a 25 basis point increase in rates judged that the latest macroeconomic data pointed to rising inflation expectations.
neutral	The Board also discussed the possibility of introducing negative interest rates. 
hawkish	The forecast expected inflation to continue rising gradually and exceed the 2% target at the start of 2016.
dovish	At the same time, these members pointed to the persistently weak investment demand of the private sector.
hawkish	According to the new forecast, sustainable fulfilment of the target, which is a condition for a return to conventional monetary policy, would thus occur in mid-2017. 
hawkish	However, several members noted that the consumer price index for March appeared to confirm the assumption in the Report that the pass-through of the VAT increase to prices was faster and greater than previously thought.
hawkish	It was observed that the annual growth rate of the average net wage earnings economy-wide had witnessed only a very slight slowdown October through November, similarly to the dynamics of unit wage costs in industry, and had remained in the two-digit range.
dovish	In addition, several members noted that decelerating the decline in real economic activity, preventing a further narrowing of credit supply and easing the conditions for forint lending also made it necessary to reduce interest rates.
hawkish	In a discussion about domestic economic developments, there was a consensus that the growth of the domestic economy could be regarded as robust and sustainable.
hawkish	In line with the forecast, economic activity had recovered in 2013 Q4 and even recorded a noticeably stronger rate of growth. 
neutral	Such a monetary policy configuration is further aimed at achieving the objective of ensuring medium-term price stability while preserving financial stability and cushioning the adverse impact of domestic and external factors on the recovery of the Romanian economy.
hawkish	The MNB would sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate.
hawkish	There was a consensus that the upside risks to inflation also included the robust economic growth in neighbouring countries, as the latest indicators from these countries were even better than originally assumed in the forecast.
hawkish	Those members assessed that the rise in net core inflation and the continuing high growth of food prices will probably result in CPI inflation remaining above the inflation target throughout 2008.
neutral	Market expectations had moved in line with the Bank?s forward guidance announced in September and were consistent with maintaining the base rate unchanged over the entire forecast horizon.
hawkish	On the other hand, private consumption growth ? the driving force behind last year?s step-up in GDP dynamics to 4.8 percent ? had climbed to a nine-year high of 7.3 percent, mainly on account of higher real disposable income.
hawkish	Whole-economy wage growth was likely to remain strong, as a result of continued strong demand for labour and the wage agreement at the end of last year.
hawkish	On the other hand, the majority of economic sentiment indicators rose, which may indicate an improvement in the economic situation in the months to come.
neutral	As for the assessment of the domestic economic situation, a majority of the board members did not see any major risks, although GDP growth had been slightly weaker than forecasted at the end of last year. 
hawkish	Inflationary pressure arising from postponed price hikes might build up as the recovery proceeded.
dovish	Moreover, the decline in inflation might be curbed in the longer term by structural changes in the Polish economy boosting demand for market services.
dovish	On the supply side, most economic sectors reported a relatively less favourable performance than in the previous period, consisting either in slower annual growth rates (industry and services) or contractions in business volumes (construction).
hawkish	One argument in favour of continued robust economic growth was the still high level of consumer confidence.
neutral	It was said several times that there was no apparent risk of deflation despite the accumulation of anti-inflationary factors, and that inflation expectations were anchored, or not falling. 
dovish	As was the case in earlier months, the majority of members thought it was likely that, after the unwinding of the supply shocks hitting Hungary, inflation would revert to levels consistent with price stability.
dovish	The cut in the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent also translates into a narrower gap between its level and the effective rate on sterilization operations.
neutral	The Board discussed the current financial market situation in depth. 
dovish	Members agreed that slack domestic demand and the negative output gap continued to be the most important factors contributing to the disinflation process.
hawkish	Monetary Council members also agreed that there had been a sustained and significant improvement in perceptions of risks associated with the Hungarian economy over recent months and that the risk of contagion through CEE financial markets had diminished.
dovish	Monetary Council members agreed that ? despite the pick-up in economic growth this year ? output would remain below its potential level and the unemployment rate would remain elevated on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.
neutral	It was observed that the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector had seen its decline come to a halt, remaining relatively constant in April and May, at a level only slightly below the Q1 average.
hawkish	It was said that year-on-year average nominal wage growth in the business sector was surprisingly high given the low economic activity. 
neutral	The time profile of this year?s economic growth was characterised by duality. 
hawkish	The preliminary estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter suggested a gradual improvement in the outlook for economic growth.
hawkish	The new forecast of the medium-term economic developments underscores heightened and more complex risks, especially those related to a rise in incomes insufficiently supported by productivity gains, higher public spending in the run-up to successive forthcoming elections and uncertainties over investors' appetite for emerging markets risk.
dovish	According to statistical data, year-on-year inflation rate slowed faster than forecast, to stand at 3.81 percent in February versus 4.01 percent in the previous month, 4.87 percent in December 2006 and 8.49 percent in February 2006.
hawkish	In that context, reference was made to the two-digit levels (particularly high from a historical perspective and compared with those recorded in 2016) further posted in Q3 by the annual dynamics of the average gross nominal wage and of the total hourly labour costs.
neutral	Additionally, the same members suggested that it was probable that Poland would join the ERM II in 2010.
hawkish	The strong expansion in household consumption had been the main driving force behind growth. 
dovish	Economic growth was expected to slow in early 2016 as EU transfers decline.
neutral	Inflationary pressures in the economy were likely to remain moderate for an extended period.
dovish	The reduction in the annual inflation rate was mainly attributed to the fall in volatile food prices over June-September and the fading-out of most of the first-round effect of the VAT rate hike.
neutral	Due to the persistent weakness of domestic demand, inflation was expected to ease back to close the 3% target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy and, therefore, interest rate policy should adopt a wait-and-see approach until incoming data suggest otherwise.
hawkish	It was mentioned several times that fiscal policy might be more relaxed in future years than assumed by the forecast and that this would imply an increase in domestic demand pressures.
neutral	Thus, they were convinced that a more comprehensive assessment of the scale of wage pressure strengthening will only be possible after more labour market data are released.
dovish	Monthly increases in consumer prices in February and March 2013 stood at historically low levels, reflecting the reduction in inflation expectations.
dovish	Declining consumption was also partly related to the deceleration in lending to households.
neutral	This was one of the factors helping inflation to return to the target in the first half of next year in the forecast.
neutral	Decision-makers? views were divided on the causes of the forint depreciation in recent weeks. 
dovish	Looking forward, companies? efforts to rebuild profitability, loose labour market conditions and the adjustment of inflation expectations were expected to lead to moderate earnings growth.
neutral	The improvement in inflation developments and the related outlook has enabled the central bank to gradually adjust the monetary policy stance over the past few months, under conditions compatible with effectively anchoring inflation expectations and in parallel with closely monitoring domestic and external developments.
hawkish	The tight labour market, coupled with strong wage growth and a higher inflation environment, might lead to increases in inflation expectations and strengthen second-round inflation risks.
neutral	The Board discussed the structure of inflation and future scenarios for inflation
dovish	As expected, the sizeable downward correction had owed mainly to the disinflationary base effects which, during that period, had strongly marked the dynamics of volatile and administered prices and, to a lesser extent, the change in tobacco product prices.
dovish	Weaker-than-expected global and European activity had been reflected in the performance of the Hungarian export sector, consumption and investment activity and subdued net inflows of foreign direct investment.
dovish	In the discussion of the lower-than-forecasted GDP growth and the structure of GDP formation, mention was made of the sharp decline in construction output.
neutral	The October situation report assessed the risks to the new forecast as being balanced.
dovish	The short-term inflation outlook has worsened due to a prolonged impact of drought on food prices and uncertainties related to the evolution of leu's exchange rate given the difficulty of assessing the duration and the effects of the recent world financial markets turbulences.
neutral	Sentiment in global financial markets had been volatile since the Council?s latest interest rate- setting decision, mainly influenced by the outcome of the referendum on EU membership in the United Kingdom and uncertainty around the country?s exit from the EU.
hawkish	It was said that the decline in unemployment and some indications from the corporate sector suggested that the labour market would not be able to accommodate further economic growth easily.
hawkish	Others also emphasised that inflationary pressures in Europe could be expected to pick up.
dovish	The domestic economy thus remained anti-inflationary in a context of very low nominal wage growth.
hawkish	The Council raised the interest rates.
dovish	In the opinion of those members of the Council, only the data released in the coming months will enable the assessment whether economic slowdown in Poland will be strong or limited. 
hawkish	Members supporting an increase in interest rates stressed that private sector wage growth had exceeded the Bank?s earlier expectations for several months now.
neutral	Core inflation had gone up slightly again to 2.7%, in line with the forecast.
dovish	The NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR?s standing facilities around the policy rate.
hawkish	Members agreed that the February projection, according to which inflation could be above target in 2009 assuming unchanged monetary conditions, should remain the starting point.
neutral	The evolution of inflation was largely consistent with the previous favourable path, and the latest inflation data did not influence the outlook for future inflation.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing opinion was that the risks of the inflation forecast were balanced and that the appropriate response was to leave rates at the current level.
hawkish	At the same time it decided to increase the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 2.0% and 4.0% respectively.
neutral	The Council judged that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate was consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the economy.
neutral	The NBR Board is restating that it will continue to manifest the utmost vigilance in fulfilling its objectives in what concerns price stability as well as ensuring financial stability.
hawkish	 A majority of the board members felt that there was no need to fear such a reaction, as most of the market was expecting a rate hike.
dovish	They emphasized that low economic activity in the euro area would be a factor curbing GDP growth in Poland.
hawkish	It was stated in the discussion that this was consistent with the persisting attractiveness of the Czech economy and the still sufficient room for foreign direct investment inflow.
dovish	The prospects for the inflation rate to drop to around nil in the following three to four quarters cause these monetary policy decisions to foster lending in a manner supportive of sustainable economic growth and, at the same time, to keep real deposit rates in positive territory.
dovish	Disinflationary effects had strengthened generally.
hawkish	In that context, it was shown that the annual growth rate of average gross nominal wage earnings economy-wide had picked up further in the period from June to July and consolidated at particularly high two-digit levels from a historical perspective and above those recorded in 2016.
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period.
hawkish	Figures from the real economy suggested a risk of higher-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter of 2007.
hawkish	While discussing the outlook for domestic economic growth, it was assessed that the Polish economy had already entered the phase of recovery, which was confirmed, among other things, by increasing industrial output growth and very good financial results of enterprises in 2009 Q3.
neutral	The Council kept the interest rates unchanged.
neutral	Domestic inflation would stay above the 2% target for most of 2018, though within the tolerance band. 
neutral	Global financial markets had been calm overall since the Council?s latest interest rate-setting decision.
neutral	Gross fixed capital formation was anticipated to have a positive, albeit modest contribution.
neutral	The NBR will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings to counteract inflationary pressures in order to resume the assumed disinflation trajectory and achieve medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner.
dovish	At the same time, aggregate demand deficit and the declining annual lending to the private sector both persist.
hawkish	The possibility of an increase in inflation expectations, a slightly weaker exchange rate of the koruna against the euro and higher commodity prices (especially oil prices) were identified as upside risks to inflation. 
hawkish	With regard to the future path of interest rates, the risks were heading upwards.
dovish	The level of output remained below its potential and was likely to approximate that level again at the end of the horizon relevant for monetary policy.
dovish	It was said that, aside from the impacts of the indirect tax increases, the planned reform of public finances would also probably generate a slowdown in demand-pull inflation impulses. 
dovish	Expected developments in core inflation suggested that there might be a transition to a lower inflation environment over the forecast period.
dovish	It was said several times that although the need for easy monetary conditions had decreased since the previous meeting, it remained high, as evidenced by the only slow return of inflation to the inflation target from below over the monetary policy horizon.
hawkish	Certain Council members argued that should a sharp rise in inflationary pressure appear in the coming quarters, it might be advisable to consider raising NBP interest rates in the second half of 2021.
dovish	The economic activity outlook for the euro area countries had been lowered.
dovish	The environment was currently one of low inflation, as evidenced in particular by low wage growth.
neutral	The prevailing view was that monetary policy rates had fallen to a sufficiently low level to allow the economy to cope with the fall in aggregate demand.
dovish	The possibility of significantly lower interest rates in the euro area was discussed in the context of the recent dramatic interest rate reduction in the USA. 
neutral	In members? judgement, enhancing the role of the central bank inflation target as an anchor was a key task for monetary policy. 
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, there remained a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy.
dovish	Market optimism had deteriorated in the past two weeks. 
dovish	However, other members maintained that given the persistence of the negative output gap in the Polish economy, a fall of inflation could be expected in subsequent quarters.
hawkish	In conclusion of the discussion it was agreed that the sustained fast growth of demand, the tight labour market, the significant increase in current inflation and the risk of the related second-round effects, as well as the expected considerable surge in demand of the public finance sector until the end of 2008, all warranted the assessment that the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target over the monetary policy transmission horizon was significant and this necessitated an interest rate increase at the November meeting.
neutral	Based on the votes cast, the Council left the base rate unchanged at 8.00%. 
dovish	In year-on-year terms, GDP had continued falling, doing so faster than the forecast had assumed.
neutral	While considering the decision on the interest rates, the Council assessed that the information on economic developments released since the last MPC meeting justified keeping the rates unchanged at the current meeting.
hawkish	The size and timing of the interest rate increase was discussed. 
hawkish	As a result of the discussion some members concluded that the assessment of the inflation outlook based of the ECMOD-based October inflation projection and considering factors not accounted for in the projection indicated that the probability of inflation overshooting the target in the projection horizon was significant and warrant raising interest rates at the October meeting.
hawkish	In order to prevent second-round effects of the VAT rate hike, the monetary policy stance aims to firmly anchor inflation expectations.
dovish	It was emphasized that reduction in lending has a negative impact on economic activity in Poland.
neutral	As expected, annual growth in the Czech economy had slowed to 3% in 2016 Q1.
dovish	The overall risks of the forecast were assessed as being slightly on the downside, with the principal upside and downside risks diverging to either side rather significantly.
neutral	In this regard, several decision- makers pointed out that a cautious monetary policy approach had to be maintained.
hawkish	The Council members recognised that, in order to decrease inflation to the NBP target in the medium term, NBP interest rates should be raised.
neutral	The Council addressed the prospects of economic growth and their impact on inflation. 
hawkish	Board members expressed their concerns about the labour market tightness as well.
dovish	The sharp deterioration in the external environment worsened the short-term outlook for exports. 
neutral	While discussing the outlook for inflation in Poland, the Council addressed the results of the inflation projection based on the NECMOD model and other forecasts.
dovish	In this context, it was emphasised that industrial output in February had declined following its merely slight increase in January, whereas construction output growth continued to be negative.
hawkish	It was said repeatedly that the current level of monetary policy rates was low and could present a risk in the longer term from the financial stability perspective. 
neutral	With regard to the developments in Poland?s real economy, it was pointed out that GDP growth was likely to remain close to the previous year?s level.
hawkish	However, the assessment made by Board members also revealed prevailing upside risks to the short-term forecast, related to post-election developments, with implications on the longer-term inflation outlook.
neutral	Following an assessment of the new forecast taking into account the need to continue disinflation in the medium term, in line with the euro adoption calendar as well as of the medium-term risks and uncertainties related to the inflation outlook, especially the factors outside the central bank's authority, the NBR Board has set the 2009 inflation target at 3.5 percent, with a target band of +/- one percentage point.
hawkish	External inflationary environment was rising due to sharp increases in global commodity prices and international freight costs.
dovish	Some members noted that the outlook for growth in the global economy remained uncertain and it was difficult to tell whether the downturn would entail just one or more dips. 
dovish	In addition to the latest available inflation data, adjustment by firms through wages and employment also pointed to a reduction in upside risks to inflation.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing opinion was that the risks to monetary-policy relevant inflation were balanced.
dovish	One member thought that the slowdown in economic growth left firms with less room to raise prices, which could act to reduce the rate of wage growth.
dovish	However, some of the board members expressed the view that the aforementioned anti-inflationary risks were so significant that a downward movement of interest rates could be imagined if they were to materialise.
neutral	However, these Council members indicated that, in light of the data available at the time of the meeting, stabilisation of the interest rates in the following quarters was the most likely scenario.
hawkish	Employment and the share of unemployed persons were both doing better than forecasted.
dovish	There was a consensus that the balance of risks to the current forecast was slightly anti-inflationary at the monetary policy horizon. 
neutral	The Bank Board went on to discuss the domestic factors underlying inflation and agreed that the domestic economy was not inflationary in its effect.
neutral	In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as trends in the international financial markets was considered, including, among others, interest rate disparity, current account balance, outlook for economic growth, inflow of foreign direct investment, EU funds and transfers of earnings made by economic migrants as well as global liquidity and investment strategies of world financial market participants.
hawkish	Growth was expected to accelerate further in the coming quarters, driven by both exports and domestic demand components.
hawkish	The NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 7.0 percent
hawkish	The recent increase in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects signalled a strengthening of persistent inflationary trends.
dovish	At the same time it was emphasized that deteriorating situation in the labour market was curbing consumer demand which was reflected by retail sales data.
dovish	In the current recessionary environment, a negative output gap and below-target inflation could be expected over the medium term.
dovish	Moreover, the Council decided that strong contraction in lending justified lowering the required reserve rate by 50 basis points at the current meeting.
hawkish	In the opinion of some Council members, high economic growth in the coming years will be favoured by strong economic growth in EU countries.
neutral	The opinion was expressed in the discussion that a sharper reduction in monetary policy rates was not necessarily the optimal response, as it would not necessarily influence effectively the situation in the interbank market and might also send out the wrong signal regarding the soundness of the Czech financial sector and the prospects for the domestic economy.
hawkish	The monetary policy stance, assessed via broad monetary conditions, remained prudent in the context of a pre-emptive tightening of money market liquidity control and of the maintenance of restrictive minimum reserve requirements.
hawkish	They assessed that ? similarly to many other countries ? the period of heightened inflation may prove longer than expected so far.
neutral	The majority of the Council members assessed that stabilisation of the NBP interest rates was likely in the following quarters, since ? given the available information ? it had been helping to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintain macroeconomic balance. 
neutral	With regard to the future path of interest rates, the risks were balanced. 
dovish	The NBR Board has decided to adjust its broad monetary conditions to the new context by lowering the monetary policy rate to 8.0 percent per annum from 8.75 percent, by pursuing an adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations in line with financial market conditions and by leaving unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratios.
hawkish	On the next occasion, in March 2018, the Council would decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and would adjust the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly.
hawkish	This had been due to a stronger recovery in adjusted inflation excluding fuels, caused mainly by faster growth in prices of non-tradable goods.
neutral	Thereafter, it would converge slowly from low positive values towards the inflation target, which it would reach at the end of 2010.
dovish	In terms of the Council?s future interest rate decisions, members agreed that the Council should consider a further reduction in interest rates if data in the coming months confirmed that the improvement in financial market sentiment persisted and the medium-term outlook for inflation remained consistent with the 3% target. 
hawkish	Domestic demand was expected to strengthen in the coming years.
hawkish	Consumption growth continues to be supported by rising employment and robust consumer sentiment.
neutral	The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in implementing structural reforms are pivotal to ensuring a stable macroeconomic framework and enhancing the resilience of the Romanian economy to withstand adverse conditions worldwide.
neutral	At the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the first three quarters of 2009, headline inflation was expected to be in the lower half of the inflation-target tolerance band.
dovish	It was said that the spreading debt problems in the south of the euro area had undermined confidence within the external financial sector and that the lower sentiment was spreading to the external and domestic real economy.
dovish	It was said several times that the external forecasts predicting a relatively rapid rebound might be overly optimistic. 
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, the March outturn for inflation was broadly in line with the projection produced by Bank staff.
dovish	Household consumption, however, which was relevant in terms of inflationary pressures from the domestic real economy, was likely to grow only slowly, and therefore the real economic environment was expected to continue to have a disinflationary impact, although to a declining extent.
dovish	According to the members? opinion, the prospective rate of growth of the Hungarian economy continues to slightly lag behind its potential.
neutral	However, there were significant differences among the countries of the region, and therefore it was useful to distinguish between them.
hawkish	While discussing the interest rate decision, the Council assessed that the continuing high growth of wages and employment, along with the possibility of increased inflation expectations resulting from higher current inflation and the expected further increase of administered prices, both pointed to the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term.
neutral	In the debate about inflation and its components, it was said that inflation was developing in line with the forecast. 
dovish	Those members also pointed out that the persistently unfavourable situation in the euro area labour market contributed to curbing consumer demand, which was reflected in the decline in retail sales in the first months of 2010.
neutral	In assessing inflation developments, Council members agreed that as a result of coronavirus, pricing decisions in recent months had been characterised by greater uncertainty.
neutral	The opinion was expressed that a sharp increase in interest rates could be counterproductive from the financial stability perspective by putting an excessive load on indebted entities. 
hawkish	The rise of aggregate demand, boosted mainly by higher incomes and non-government credit dynamics, has been faster than the aggregate supply advance, causing exogenous shocks to feed through into prices and making the external deficit widen further.
dovish	They pointed out that the investment activity of enterprises might be curbed by the uncertainty about the situation in the external environment of the Polish economy, limited lending, relatively high fiscal burden, as well as by administrative and legal barriers. 
dovish	The Council members underlined that NBP would continue to purchase Treasury securities and debt securities guaranteed by the State Treasury in the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations.
hawkish	Some Council members emphasised that the inflation forecasts used at the NBP pointed to a higher inflation path than it had been forecasted a quarter before. 
neutral	Attention was also paid to the fact that no further interest rate cuts were implemented by central banks of Central and Eastern Europe.
neutral	While discussing the current level of interest rates in Poland, it was assessed that the uncertainty concerning the situation in the external environment and its impact on the Polish economy, including the zloty exchange rate developments, justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged.
neutral	In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 7.0 percent per annum
neutral	During the discussions, some members reiterated that the current corridor formed by interest rates on the NBR?s standing facilities was likely to provide increased flexibility to monetary policy.
dovish	A degree of unused capacity remained in the economy, and therefore the domestic real economic environment continued to have a disinflationary impact. 
hawkish	Board members pointed out that the deterioration of labour market developments had been cushioned in April by firms? recourse to furlough, which had been financially supported by the authorities, while in May it had been mitigated by the resumption of activity in some sectors, as well as by new government support measures. 
neutral	One member commented that price stability had already been achieved and inflation over the forecast horizon was expected to be in line with the inflation target set by the Bank under the MNB Act.
dovish	In the area of government investment, by contrast, the opinions were generally sceptical, partly due to slower drawdown of European funds.
hawkish	It was noted that the annual inflation rate had confirmed the upward expectations in December 2016.
dovish	Several Council members thought that, due to a deterioration in economic prospects, the risks around the inflation projection had become more evenly balanced over recently.
dovish	While addressing domestic economic activity in early 2013, it was indicated that GDP growth in the first quarter was significantly weaker than expected. 
neutral	Members agreed that there remained significant uncertainty around the central projection in the Report.
neutral	While addressing inflation expectations, it was emphasised that although one-year ahead inflation forecasts by financial sector analysts were consistent with the NBP?s inflation target, expectations of households and enterprises were largely based on current inflation.
hawkish	Real interest rates would remain significantly negative even so.
hawkish	The Czech economy was above its potential output level amid accelerating economic growth.
dovish	Those Council members also pointed out that future decline in inflation was additionally signalled by continuously decreasing growth in M3 aggregate.
hawkish	Greater or lengthier overloading of global supply chains, which could result in even stronger growth in producer prices, was an inflationary risk to the forecast.
hawkish	It was also said that utilisation of production capacities was higher than in past years.
hawkish	Nevertheless, the forecasted increase in annual consumer prices will continue to be significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the 2008 inflation target, requiring the maintenance of a tight monetary policy stance for a longer period.
hawkish	A significant improvement of the liquidity in the banking sector is worth noting.
neutral	Although the upward revision to the projection mainly reflected the higher forecast for energy prices and so it was believed to be a temporary factor, with its effect unwinding by 2009, the uncertainty around the central projection pointing to higher inflation should not be ignored.
dovish	The fading-out of the VAT hike impact and the relatively favourable development in food prices have contributed to a rapid slowdown in inflation.
dovish	Economic growth would slow to 1.5% this year as a result of fiscal restriction, fading investment in inventories and slowing external economic activity.
dovish	The updated forecast shows a continuation of disinflation but also a relative heightening of domestic risks related to the fulfilment of fiscal and incomes policy objectives in the public sector and of uncertainties related to developments in external markets amid recent tensions regarding the public finance crisis in Greece. 
neutral	The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and the inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period.
hawkish	The fairly strong consumption persistence of Czech households, which was slowing the decline in aggregate demand, was identified as a factor supporting moderate optimism. 
hawkish	At the same time it decided to increase the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 1.75 % and 3.75 % respectively. 
neutral	It was indicated that the stabilisation of monetary policy parameters is conducive, particularly given increased uncertainty, to maintaining macroeconomic stability.
hawkish	Inflation had risen to decade highs in several countries, which had been further aggravated by disruptions in supply in a growing number of markets, in addition to persistent rises in commodity and energy prices.
dovish	Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, had been slowing the rise in domestic prices.
neutral	Council members discussed the level of interest rates and the impact of monetary policy tightening on economic growth.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that the current exchange rate and the demand effect of the planned fiscal consolidation were among the downside risks to inflation
hawkish	With the favourable changes in conditions in global financial markets, CDS spreads and government bond yields in Central and Eastern European countries had fallen, and exchange rates had appreciated.
dovish	It was indicated that this increased the likelihood of a slowdown in the world economy, in particular in Great Britain and, consequently, the euro area.
neutral	In this context, a lot of attention was paid to the current macroeconomic situation and monetary policy in some small open economies.
dovish	Other members of the Council emphasized, however, that the June projection of the NBP pointed at the considerable widening of the negative output gap leading to a strong decline in inflationary pressure over the monetary policy transmission horizon.
hawkish	While discussing the outlook for economic activity in Poland, some Council members assessed that both the available forecasts and the incoming data, including data on GDP in 2010 Q2 and on industrial output and retail sales in 2010 Q3, suggested that GDP continued on an upward trend.
neutral	The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data reveals that inflation posted developments in line with the central bank?s previous projections.
neutral	A number of members emphasised that, following the Bank?s forward guidance accompanying the July and August policy decisions, maintaining interest rates was consistent with market expectations in terms of credibility and fitted well with the Council?s earlier communication.
dovish	The majority of the Council members judged that monetary conditions should be eased in order to mitigate the negative economic impact of the spread of the coronavirus. 
dovish	Following discussion of the latest macroeconomic news and financial market developments, members of the Council agreed that the outlook for inflation had improved recently, due to the worsening prospects for the global economy.
hawkish	Within this, the stock of lending to SMEs had grown even more strongly. 
hawkish	The MNB laid special emphasis on developments in inflation expectations following the restart of the economy, and on the neutralisation of potential second-round effects.
dovish	It was also indicated that deteriorating financial situation of enterprises was hindering their investment activity.
dovish	Second, they noted that August?s was the second consecutive Report which contained a lower inflation projection than the target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.
neutral	The exit from the exchange rate commitment at the start of April represented a shift of monetary policy towards a neutral stance.
hawkish	It was noted that the disinflation process had come to an end, despite moderate wage growth, with the sharp increase in food prices playing a key role.
dovish	Further dampening of inflationary pressures would be aided by a slowdown in economic growth.
neutral	In this regard, wage developments over the coming months might be of crucial importance. 
dovish	Members were in agreement that, with the worsening of problems in the US mortgage market, there had been a significant deterioration in the international investment environment and a considerable increase in financial market uncertainty.
neutral	The board members agreed that there were many mutually conflicting tendencies in both the domestic and external economy and that this implied an unusually high degree of uncertainty for the decision-making process.
neutral	At the same time, reference was made to the relative stability of the EUR/RON exchange rate for most of Q3.
hawkish	Core inflation had been rising gradually as a result of an expansion in household consumption and an acceleration in wage growth.
dovish	The real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector are still in negative territory, despite a relative improvement in the developments in domestic currency loans.
neutral	Before the immediate policy decision, the Monetary Council took a decision on the abandonment of the peg of the forint to the euro and the fluctuation band of the domestic currency.
neutral	The international reserves remain in a comfortable zone while a substantial part of the IMF loan under the 2009-2011 arrangement has been repaid.
hawkish	Members of the Council pointed to a gradual acceleration of economic growth in Poland which in 2010 Q3 exceeded expectations.
dovish	The Federal Reserve had continued its liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes.
hawkish	Sustained rises in commodity prices and international freight costs pointed to a higher external inflation environment.
dovish	The board members agreed that the appropriate response to the current situation was to lower rates.
hawkish	Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector were likely to continue in the coming months.
neutral	It was remarked that an assessment as comprehensive as possible of the implications of those measures on the short- and medium-term outlook was warranted.
dovish	Statistical data show the annual inflation rate remaining at low levels after the fading of the impact arising from the cut in the VAT rate for some bakery products.
hawkish	The present forecast shows that annual inflation is likely to temporarily remain above the upper limit of the variation band around the target in the following months and reveals risks similar to those underlined in the previous forecasting exercise.
hawkish	They also emphasised that the high growth in investments and restructuring taking place in enterprises were contributing to the growth of potential GDP, which would be easing inflationary pressure.
neutral	The Council considered a wide range of incoming data; however, those data influenced the Council?s assessments only through their effects on developments in inflation. 
neutral	The exchange rate of the leu posted wider swings, owing to heightened volatility of investors? risk appetite, as well as to the persistence of uncertainty surrounding economic activity in Europe and elsewhere.
hawkish	In that case, the likelihood of so-called second-round inflationary effects of the cost shocks, working through expectations, was greater.
hawkish	 Nonetheless, GDP growth, which had jumped to 3% in year-on-year terms, had been higher than forecasted. 
dovish	Meanwhile, the spread between interbank money market rates and the monetary policy rate widened in the context of a heightened impact on the money market of the substantial budget deficit financing needs for the last quarter of this year.
neutral	In arguing to leave interest rates unchanged, some of the board members mentioned their uncertainty regarding the equilibrium paths specified in the model.
dovish	The rate of wage growth was likely to slow, because of the slowdown in economic activity.
dovish	The downward effect on inflation of the decline in domestic demand, which Bank staff assumed with a considerable degree of caution due to a lack of past empirical data, might actually be stronger than in the inflation projection.
neutral	There was a consensus at the meeting that the forecast contained in the third situation report was being fulfilled very well. 
neutral	The NBR reiterates that the adequate use of its available tools amid a close monitoring of domestic and global economic developments is aimed at ensuring price stability over the medium term and financial stability.
hawkish	They assessed that there is a considerable risk that in the medium term the GDP growth exceeding the growth of potential output will lead to a rise in inflation above the inflation target.
neutral	It was assessed that global economic growth remained moderate.
neutral	The fiscal measures currently under debate and their implications for inflation and monetary policy were also discussed.
hawkish	While addressing the current inflation, it was pointed out that following a long period of inflation running below the inflation target, in October the annual growth of consumer price exceeded the inflation target of 2.5%.
neutral	The Board discussed whether it was necessary to further ease the monetary conditions and also discussed a possible way of doing so.
dovish	Reductions in utilities prices at the start of the year had led to a material slowdown in consumer price inflation.
neutral	In the second half of the forecast period, inflation was likely to move in line with the inflation target, reflecting the recovery in activity and the increase in wage dynamics, as the effects of cost shocks faded away. 
neutral	The majority of Council members judged the probability of inflation running below or above the inflation target to be balanced in the medium term.
dovish	While discussing the current economic situation, the Council members drew attention to the fact that the global economic situation had substantially deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by numerous countries to contain its spread.
dovish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the prevailing view was that the overall macroeconomic environment was anti-inflationary and that the appropriate response would be to lower rates.
dovish	Board members remarked that, in Q1, economic expansion had witnessed a stronger-than-anticipated loss of momentum in annual terms.
neutral	The new situation report assessed the risks in relation to the forecast overall as being broadly balanced. 
hawkish	This would affect inflation primarily by increasing the contribution of growth in indirect taxes.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, based on the above factors, there was no material inflationary pressure in the economy, and therefore an accommodative stance of monetary policy was warranted in order to achieve the inflation target over the medium term.
hawkish	It was pointed out that rising inflation expectations might add to wage pressure.
hawkish	Based on the incoming data, Hungarian GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021 had significantly exceeded the MNB?s March projection and market expectations as well.
neutral	Looking ahead, Hungarian economic growth might continue in a more balanced pattern than previously.
neutral	Jir¡ Rusnok said that the persisting external uncertainties (deglobalisation, trade wars, Brexit and the shift towards green energy), which had escalated further with the ongoing pandemic, had now been joined by domestic uncertainties. 
hawkish	Behind the step-up in the annual inflation rate had stood primarily the faster dynamics of fuel prices, which had reverted to positive readings in December, prompted by the advance in oil prices on international markets.
dovish	In November 2015, the aggregate consumer price level stood 1.1 percent lower than in the same year-earlier period. 
dovish	Overall, demand was likely to remain below the productive capacity of the economy, and therefore the real economic environment was expected to remain disinflationary looking ahead. 
neutral	The majority of the Council members judged that in the light of current information inflation in the next two years would be running close to the inflation target.
dovish	On the other hand, it was emphasized that growing unemployment and anticipated decline in wage growth as well as worse consumer sentiment as compared with the previous years constituted factors that might be conducive to limiting future consumption demand.
neutral	Turning to GDP formation, it was shown that agriculture had played an important part, its contribution (the largest in four years) standing higher than that of industry and being exceeded only by that of services.
neutral	Significant differences remained across the individual regions in terms of economic growth.
neutral	In the Council?s view, the current interest rate decision was consistent with the Bank?s past behaviour and previous communication as well as with market expectations, and therefore it strengthened the Bank's credibility and predictability. 
hawkish	In his opinion, this was leading many people to invest in property in fear of the expected high inflation. 
dovish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board agreed that domestic economic activity was subdued and therefore anti-inflationary.omestic economic activity was subdued and therefore anti-inflationary. 
hawkish	There was a consensus that the observed recovery in domestic economic activity was robust and gaining pace.
neutral	While considering the decision on interest rates, the Council concluded that the information on the economic situation released since the last meeting warranted keeping the interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.
dovish	While analysing developments in loan aggregates, some Council members highlighted the continuing fall in consumer loans, along with a deceleration in the expansion of housing loans at the beginning of 2011.
neutral	In 2013 the economic was expected to grow by just under 2% in connection with a recovery in external demand.
neutral	At the close of the meeting, the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 3.25%.
hawkish	It was observed that forecasts for global economic growth had recently been revised upwards and pointed to its acceleration in 2017.
dovish	The deflationary tendencies on the labour market were also posited as a possible explanation of the observed decline in wages in 2013 Q4.
hawkish	Retail sales data were judged to indicate sustained consumer demand expansion, at a rate close to that observed in the previous quarters.
neutral	The monetary policy stance remained prudent, with the NBR permanently calibrating its broad monetary conditions with the view to consolidating the convergence of inflation towards medium-term objectives and ensuring favorable conditions for a sustainable revival of lending activity.
hawkish	This deviation from the prediction had been due mainly to significantly better than expected net exports on the back of recovering external demand. 
hawkish	Some members warned that the liberalisation of the energy market would also pose upside risks to the outlook for inflation.
hawkish	It was said that the rapid rise in wages and the forecast for further wage growth were signalling the emergence of the first inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.
hawkish	The new forecast retains its upward profile, amid inflationary pressures from excess aggregate demand and unit labour costs.
neutral	Several Council members claimed that the picture concerning the likely inflation trend has not become considerably clearer since previous month?s meeting.
neutral	They argued that the wage growth acceleration does not necessarily have to lead to inflation growth due to the very good financial standing of enterprises which makes it possible for them to partially absorb wage increases without the need to raise their prices.
dovish	The recent correction in the commodity markets was identified as a downside risk to inflation, as commodity prices might stabilise at lower levels than assumed by the forecast.
dovish	The significantly lower-than-expected core inflation excluding indirect tax effects and the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity indicated a strengthening in downside risks to the longer-term outlook for inflation.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that relatively pessimistic private sector expectations were a major factor, in addition to the negative growth outlook for the euro area and the impacts of fiscal consolidation, and that this pessimism was not necessarily in line with Czech economic fundamentals.
dovish	It was also pointed out that in the face of turmoil in international financial markets some central banks decided to ease or restrain further monetary policy.
dovish	The inflation pressures were therefore very subdued.
dovish	Overall, sentiment in international financial markets had rather deteriorated since the Council?s previous interest rate decision.
neutral	In connection with expected future inflation developments it was said that inflation would gradually return to the current inflation target of 3%.
neutral	While the commodity price shock, particularly the higher-than-previous path for the price of oil, would by itself have upward effects on inflation, subdued domestic demand and the loose labour market acted as a brake on price and wage increases.
dovish	It was also said that in the short term the increased uncertainty would lead to a downturn in investment activity. 
dovish	Members agreed that the significantly weaker-than-expected preliminary first-quarter GDP data may have reflected in part transient factors affecting some sectors of the economy and the faster-than-anticipated weakening in recent economic performance.
hawkish	The new decline in the unemployment rate to 5.0 percent in September was also referred to. 
neutral	Therefore, in the Council's assessment, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term was limited.
hawkish	The trade surplus, while remaining substantial in the coming years even as imports continued to rise due to increasing consumption and investment, was likely to keep the current account surplus high over the coming years.
hawkish	Some members noted that perceptions of the risks associated with the economy had fallen over the past six weeks, due mainly to an improvement in global appetite for risk and the  Government?s commitment to meeting this year?s deficit target of below 3%.
neutral	Council members judged that the picture of domestic macroeconomic conditions had not changed materially since the previous policy meeting and that the 3% inflation target could be met in 2009.
dovish	In the assessment of some Council members, economic growth in Poland may run below the central path of the June projection of the NBP, among others, due to the possibly lower economic activity abroad than accounted for in the projection, weaker than projected investment growth connected with the negative business sentiment and a stronger increase in unemployment along with the ensuing drop in households? disposable income.
neutral	At its meeting, the Council reviewed the projection in the September Inflation Report to be published on 24 September.
hawkish	The latest statistical data show an ongoing swift rate of increase of consumer demand, under the impact of the new fiscal easing measures and higher household income.
neutral	The annual inflation rate stood at 4.74 percent in December 2009.
neutral	In the Board members? opinion, the uncertainties associated with this picture continued to generate two-way risks to the inflation outlook.
neutral	Against that background, Board members underlined again the need for a balanced macroeconomic policy mix, to avoid the overburdening of monetary policy, with undesired effects in the economy.
neutral	The Council paid significant attention to the situation in the labour market and its impact on inflation outlook.
neutral	Wage data for 2006 may have been distorted by the changing seasonal pattern of bonus payments due to increases in tax and contribution rates, as well as by the one-off effects of the tightening in labour market regulations.
dovish	Those members also pointed to a decreasing wage pressure in the Polish economy.
hawkish	While analysing the current situation in the real economy and the outlook for economic growth in Poland, fast growth in industrial output, retail sales and exports was pointed out. 
hawkish	Council members agreed that the developments in the labour market were the main risk factor for inflation increase.
neutral	Moreover, most Board members reiterated the importance of an adequate dosage and pace of adjustment of the monetary policy stance, from the perspective of anchoring inflation expectations and maintaining the annual inflation rate on the trajectory shown by the NBR?s latest medium-term forecast, while safeguarding financial stability.
hawkish	It was said that a very slight rise in demand pressures generated by wage growth could be expected at the forecast horizon.
dovish	Members agreed that the current level of the central bank base rate placed a significant burden on the real economy.
neutral	In terms of their impact on inflation, however, the two forces counteracted each other.
hawkish	Council members agreed that upside risks to inflation had picked up further recently, driven by the acceleration of imported inflation on the back of rises in food and energy prices, as well as the expected increase in administered prices.
hawkish	At their November policy meeting, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve had decided to start phasing out the asset purchase programme.
dovish	At the same time, these Council members pointed to the worsening business tendency indicators.
dovish	Less encouraging signals come from the slowing activity in the industrial and construction sectors, as well as from somewhat weaker confidence in the economy. 
neutral	Council members agreed that the fundamentals of the Hungarian economy were strong and the current interest rate level continued to be consistent with the sustainable achievement of the inflation target.
hawkish	Rising world commodity prices and a weaker exchange rate might pose an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	Economic sentiment was favourable as well.
neutral	The Board focused in detail on the current inflation situation.
hawkish	According the forecast the Czech economy had been fluctuating above the non-accelerating inflation level of output for six quarters.
neutral	During the meeting the Monetary Policy Council discussed the outlook for inflation in the context of the past, current and, primarily, expected economic situation.
hawkish	According to the situation report, the changes to VAT, the rise in excise duties and the changes to regulated prices would all be more inflationary than forecasted. 
hawkish	To facilitate a decision, Pter Bihari supported an increase of 25 basis points in interest rates.
hawkish	The prudent monetary policy stance and the preventive measures taken in the area of prudential supervision of the banking sector are meant to reinforce the Romanian economy?s capacity to withstand external shocks.
hawkish	A growing contribution of prices in food services, driven, among other things, by the introduction of electronic sales registration, had been significant, as had faster growth in imputed rent due to rising prices of new properties, whose weight in the consumer price index had increased since the start of 2017.
neutral	A dichotomy was observed between the factors determining developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects.
neutral	In 2016 Q4, both headline and monetary policy-relevant inflation had risen sharply and returned to the tolerance band around the CNB?s target. 
hawkish	Economic growth this year would also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding.
hawkish	While addressing forecasts, those members argued that inflation in 2009 Q2 and Q3 proved markedly higher than expected in the June projection.
neutral	Due to base effects, inflation was expected to fall back into the central bank's tolerance band again at the beginning of 2022 and to stabilise around the central bank target from mid-2022 as a result of monetary policy measures.
dovish	Some Council members also emphasized that ? according to available forecasts ? the probability of a temporary fall in inflation below zero in summer had risen.
hawkish	It was also emphasized that the recent heated public debate about the price growth contributed to boosting inflation expectations.
neutral	In discussing interest rate policy issues, the large majority of members preferred to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, as more time was needed to assess the market reaction to the postponement of the loan review.
neutral	The upside and downside risks to inflation appeared to be broadly balanced.
neutral	However, these members assessed that the most likely scenario was a stabilisation of interest rates.
neutral	The current high inflation, however, was still assessed as being a transitory phenomenon.
neutral	Following discussions on the latest macroeconomic developments and the financial situation, members of the Monetary Council agreed that short-term inflation processes were consistent with the earlier expectations of the central bank. 
neutral	The Board stated again that the CNB would not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017. 
neutral	The Council assessed that recently the balance of risks for inflation has become more balanced, adding that the current evaluation of the inflation and growth outlook for Poland did not imply a need to cut the NBP interest rates.
neutral	The new situation report assessed the risks in relation to the forecast overall as being balanced.
dovish	While discussing the decision on interest rates, some Council members assessed that further deterioration in the outlook for global economic growth, including the recession observed in Poland?s major trading partners, the signs of considerable decline in economic activity in Poland in subsequent quarters and the resulting anticipated significant lowering of the inflationary pressure in the medium term justified easing the monetary policy at the Council?s November meeting.
dovish	Lower inflation had been fostered by a stronger exchange rate and the impacts of the proposed fiscal consolidation. 
hawkish	 Renewed growth in investment would foster higher economic growth.
neutral	It was said that in an economy where inflation had long been close to the inflation target, inflation expectations were well anchored. 
neutral	The forecast assumed that market interest rates would be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate would be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017.
neutral	Voted in favour of this decision.
hawkish	 The prevailing view in the discussion was that the newly observed growth in nominal unit wage costs in industry was indicating wage-cost pressures.
hawkish	The latest inflation data suggested that prices would rise more rapidly over the near term than in the baseline projection in the August Report.
dovish	Those Council members also pointed to the persistent unfavourable situation in the labour market as a factor contributing to lower consumption and, consequently, weaker economic activity.
dovish	In addition, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank would launch a targeted programme aimed at purchasing mortgage bonds with maturities of three years or more.
dovish	The Board then discussed GDP, which had recorded a lower-than-forecasted year-on-year decline. 
neutral	Members agreed that a further increase in interest rates now was not justified along the path of inflation implied by the Report.
hawkish	The improved perception of investors and rating agencies on the Romanian economy, due to the favourable developments witnessed by its fundamentals, has led to an increase in capital inflows, as also reflected in the domestic currency appreciation.
hawkish	On average, the Board inclined towards the view that the risks of the baseline scenario were broadly on the upside with regard to inflation, although some members assessed the risks as being balanced.
dovish	However, the negative output gap still persists while the revival of lending to the private sector, mainly centered on corporates, remains modest also in the context of heightened risks related to eurozone sovereign debt crisis and signals regarding a relative slowdown in the eurozone recovery.
neutral	Some Board members pointed out that estimates on potential output and potential growth, as illustrated by international experience, needed additional empirical evidence.
dovish	On another argument, loose labour market conditions, slower-than-expected earnings growth and the continued sharp adjustment by households were factors contributing to a further decline in inflation.
hawkish	Economic activity might hence be in better shape in reality than indicated by the standard macroeconomic data.
neutral	At the end of its extraordinary meeting, the Board decided to end the CNB?s exchange rate commitment. 
neutral	After the discussion, the Chairman invited members to vote on the three propositions.
hawkish	Parallel to the rise in the employment rate, the unemployment rate continued to fall.
hawkish	Despite slowing slightly in the second quarter of 2008, consumer price inflation had remained well above the inflation-target tolerance band. 
neutral	Other Council members argued that inflation expectations in Poland are adaptive in nature, and so they are greatly dependent on past inflation, which should be taken into consideration while interpreting their changes.
hawkish	They emphasised that the following factors will contribute to wage growth acceleration: significant decline in unemployment, structural mismatch in the labour market and the emigration of Polish workers to other EU countries, as well as wage convergence between Poland and EU countries.
dovish	Against this, it was argued that the previously mentioned slowdown in global economic activity, which might turn out to be far more significant than forecasted, might adversely affect the economic growth of the Czech Republic.
neutral	Members agreed that the primary objective of the MNB continued to be the achievement and maintenance of price stability.
hawkish	The NBR Board is restating that, apart from tighter monetary policy, the implementation of a restrictive economic policy mix, focusing on the fiscal and income components, and stepped-up structural reforms are essential to ensure the return to a durable downward trend in inflation, thus contributing to the achievement of sustainable economic growth in the longer term.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic indicators points to further disinflation, as a result of the decline in volatile prices, particularly food prices, as well as of the persistent negative output gap and the significant improvement in inflation expectations.
hawkish	The high rate of earnings growth at the end of 2006, particularly in the services sector, pointed to the existence of such risks.
hawkish	As a result of the dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate was likely to stabilise at high levels.
neutral	The G3 model is much more detailed, allowing for a more realistic description of the impacts of various economic shocks.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments show the resumption of the disinflation process amid a drop in adjusted CORE 21 annual inflation rate and an appreciation of the leu.
hawkish	In addition, the actions taken by the Government could make a significant contribution to an increase in the potential growth rate of the economy and to securing a sustainable debt path for the country.
dovish	By contrast, the slow growth of the domestic economy was dampening inflation.
hawkish	Some members emphasised that it would be appropriate to prevent a further rise in inflation expectations with a well-timed tightening and that the Council should not wait until such an increase in expectations was reflected in a sustained rise in inflation.
dovish	It was said that in the euro area disinflationary pressures were still evident in consumer and producer prices, which were causing lower domestic inflation via slower growth in import prices.
dovish	Some members of the Council pointed out that the crisis in the housing market and financial markets would contribute to a significant drop in consumer demand in the US economy.
dovish	Other Council members emphasised that April saw a decline in the growth rate of wages in the corporate sector.
neutral	It was repeatedly said that owing to weak domestic demand, the observed cost pressures represented by the commodity price growth were not currently an inflation risk. 
hawkish	Council members were unanimous in arguing that due to a shift in achieving the inflation target and the persistence of upside risks surrounding the outlook, it was necessary to continue the cycle of interest rate hikes and to tighten monetary conditions by using several instruments.
hawkish	Some members noted that the measures represented significant upside risks to inflation.
hawkish	The need to effectively anchor inflation expectations by avoiding their additional worsening against the background of global market tensions requires the continuation of monetary policy restrictiveness with an appropriate dosage of its instruments, while also calling for stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix.
neutral	At the meeting, members of the Council discussed the usefulness of the so-called Taylor rule in monetary policy.
neutral	At its meeting on 15 December, the Monetary Council discussed the December 2015 Inflation Report. 
hawkish	Real monetary conditions have retained their stimulative nature.
dovish	At the same time, some Council members indicated that inflationary pressures remained low in the major developed economies, where core inflation fell in April 2010 to historically low levels.
dovish	The perspectives shows a continuation of the disinflation process, though the outlook is gripped by the persistence of major uncertainties related to the volatility of the internal and external macroeconomic developments.
hawkish	The growth structure had changed, with consumption and investment now being the engines of economic growth. 
neutral	The Board agreed that the forecast risks were balanced and there were no strong arguments for either a rise or a cut in interest rates.
neutral	Recent central bank assessments show that in December 2011 the annual inflation rate will near the mid-point of the variation band around the 3 percent target, in line with the latest NBR forecast. 
hawkish	The annual inflation rate continued to rise above the upper bound of the variation band of the target in June 2021, implicitly above the forecast, climbing to 3.94 percent from 3.75 percent in May and 3.05 percent in March 2021.
hawkish	Other Council members stressed that in the past few quarters core inflation remained at an elevated level.
hawkish	However, it was also said that upside risks to inflation were emerging as a result of the continuing domestic and external economic recovery.
dovish	Board members noted that the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate would likely be stuck to a downtrend over the months ahead and would fall to 2.5 percent in December 2018, slightly below the previously-projected level, amid relatively heftier disinflationary influences from prices of some agri-food commodities.
neutral	Higher inflation pressures stemming from the external environment, most notably higher commodity price inflation, were being offset by a sharper decline in domestic inflation pressures.
dovish	In addition, the Board declared it was ready to cut interest rates further should the economic situation so require.
hawkish	Unit wage costs industry-wide had also risen at a swifter annual pace in the first month of this year ? as the growth rate of labour costs had accelerated considerably faster than that of productivity ?, so a protraction of this trend should be examined also in terms of price competitiveness of Romania?s exports.
hawkish	Persistently buoyant domestic demand was boosting.
hawkish	Several members stressed that energy prices had reached new historical highs recently and the moderation in food price inflation had been weaker than expected.
hawkish	In particular, favourable data on retail sales and improvement in leading business indicators, including a relatively high PMI, signalled steadily accelerating growth.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, the latest inflation data had been in line with expectations.
neutral	It was repeatedly noted that even in the light of the newly available data, the assumption that inflation would merely be approaching the target from below at the monetary policy horizon remained in place.
neutral	The NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged.
hawkish	Looking at economic growth, Board members mentioned that it had exceeded expectations in Q2, due mainly to household consumption, as well as to gross fixed capital formation.
neutral	The board members agreed that the Chinese coronavirus epidemic was a completely new external uncertainty, but their views of this uncertainty differed in intensity.
hawkish	There was a discussion about whether the upside risks of the forecast associated with the evolution of the domestic economy were already starting to materialise.
hawkish	The real annual growth rate of domestic currency loans gained momentum, thanks to the pass-through of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and households, also fostered by the easing of money market liquidity conditions. 
dovish	Import prices were depressing inflation.
hawkish	Several members noted that inflation was likely to rise only temporarily at the beginning of this year due to the increase in indirect taxes.
dovish	It was noted that those factors urged many central banks to further considerable interest rate cuts.
dovish	Members agreed that due to slackening domestic and external demand as well as the fall in commodity prices, inflation might fall significantly below target in 2010. 
dovish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the Board assessed the risks to the new forecast as being slightly anti-inflationary.
dovish	When discussing the current business conditions in Poland and their outlook, some Council members highlighted that the situation in the labour market was deteriorating faster than expected.
dovish	The MNB would continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets.
hawkish	Wage growth stayed above labour productivity dynamics, fuelling inflationary pressures as well as the risk of deteriorating external competitiveness.
neutral	Looking forward, market uncertainty was likely to remain for some time.
dovish	The analysis of developments in macroeconomic indicators reveals a persistent deficit of aggregate demand.
neutral	It was a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council.
neutral	They pointed out that, despite a significant risk of a fiscal policy loosening, at present it is difficult to assess the impact of this policy on inflation in the medium term.  
hawkish	The relatively sharp fall in the general unemployment rate compared to the forecast was identified as an upside factor, as it might lead to higher wage growth.
hawkish	Against this backdrop, it was highlighted that the pace of growth of Romania?s economy would probably be the fastest in the EU in 2016 and would continue afterwards to rank high in that hierarchy, including in the region.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.97 percent in February 2008 from 7.26 percent in the previous month, mainly due to the upward adjustment of natural gas prices and the persistent impact of the drop in the 2007 agricultural output on food prices.
neutral	Using negative interest rates is still a new phenomenon in monetary policy, and therefore it was useful to wait for international experience in this field.
dovish	The prevailing view was that domestic demand was subdued and that GDP growth would slow further this year.
neutral	The Board discussed the May situation report assessing the new data on the economy and the risks associated with the fulfilment of the April macroeconomic forecast.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic indicators confirms that disinflation continued, faster than it had been forecasted, with the annual inflation rate falling to 3.66 percent in March versus 4.87 percent in December, due to a slower advance in administered prices and a reduction of volatile prices.
neutral	The Board then turned to a discussion of upside and downside risks to inflation.
dovish	A motion was also submitted to decrease the basic NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point. 
dovish	The effects of the global financial and economic crisis are increasingly reflected by the reduction of both exports and external financing, an increased volatility on the domestic foreign exchange market, in line with regional trends and by lack of investor risk appetite.
dovish	Referring to the situation in Poland, Council members emphasised that recent data on economic activity, including GDP, as well as economic conditions indicators, pointed to a sharper deceleration in domestic economic growth this year than was assumed in the July projection and anticipated by external forecasters.
neutral	The members agreed that the aforementioned turbulence in global financial markets was not yet significant for the Czech economy and the monetary policy settings. 
dovish	For the months ahead, disinflation is envisaged to consolidate, along with the downward adjustment of inflation expectations against the background of maintaining a prudent monetary policy stance.
dovish	The outlook indicates the continuation of disinflation is set to continue. 
neutral	In such circumstances, the maintenance of a firm monetary policy stance as well as a consistent support from the other components of the macroeconomic policy mix is required.
hawkish	The annual inflation rate rose to 7.96 percent in December 2010, in line with the NBR forecasts, although significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the target.
hawkish	It was said that the recovery was confirmed by continuing retail sales growth.
hawkish	These measures will ensure restrictiveness of broad monetary conditions.
hawkish	The main driver of economic growth is steadily increasing consumer demand, supported by gradual improvement in the labour market, favourable household sentiment.
neutral	The meeting began with a presentation of the February situation report summarising the newly available economic data and the associated risks of the January forecast.
hawkish	Expected external economic growth had picked up pace and expected interest rates in the euro area had risen. 
dovish	The persistently low inflation environment might provide a firmer anchor for inflation expectations. 
hawkish	Against this backdrop, Board members referred to the faster-than-expected pick-up in economic growth in 2016 Q4, to 4.7 percent year on year, against 4.3 percent in the previous quarter, implying a likely wider-than-anticipated reopening of the positive output gap.
hawkish	In the meeting held today, 10 January 2022, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent per annum, from 1.75 percent per annum, as of 11 January 2022, and to maintain firm control over money market liquidity. 
neutral	In line with the Bank?s expectations, there had not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages.
hawkish	Monetary Council considered it a key priority to anchor inflation expectations properly and thereby continuously to mitigate second-round inflation risks.
hawkish	Oil prices had risen in recent months.
hawkish	There was a consensus that economic growth was sustainable.
hawkish	It was said that the positive condition of the economy was also indicated by better-than-expected performance of the revenue side of the state budget.
neutral	It was said that core inflation was still developing favourably, moving at the boundary of the tolerance band around the target.
dovish	Both the situation report and the assessment of the latest data implied a clear anti-inflationary balance of risks for the forecast.
hawkish	At the same time, these Council members judged that the ongoing economic recovery, including demand stimulated by rising household income, had also added to the price growth.
dovish	With a wider cyclical position, the ability of companies to pass on cost shocks into prices was more limited and the inflationary impact of cost shocks to companies was smaller, which in turn might warrant a further, substantial easing of policy.
neutral	It was the unanimous view of the Council that, with current monetary conditions maintained, inflation was likely to move into line with the target over the medium term.
neutral	Overall, sentiment in global financial markets had been mixed over the period since the Council?s latest policy decision.
hawkish	Both investment and final household consumption sped up, the latter being driven by significant rises in incomes and the persistently rapid increase of credit to the private sector, especially that of foreign currency-denominated loans.
dovish	The real annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory, against the background of the sharper contraction in foreign currency credit (stocks) and the ongoing operations to remove non-performing loans from credit institutions? balance sheets.
neutral	The time profile of this year?s economic growth was characterised by divergent trends.
neutral	The exchange rate of the koruna would be broadly stable over the forecast horizon. 
dovish	The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates to the level: the reference rate to 5.75%, the lombard rate to 7.25%, the deposit rate to 4.25% and the rediscount rate to 6.00%.
hawkish	Accordingly, with the exhaustion of the HUF 3,000 billion available, the Bank had closed the FGS Go!.
dovish	While analysing the inflationary processes in Poland, some members of the Council pointed out that, as anticipated, CPI inflation was running at a relatively low level.
hawkish	In that context, Board members pointed out the further double-digit annual dynamics, in the first two months of Q2, of both the average gross wage earnings and the unit wage costs in industry on the consumer goods segment, despite a moderate slowdown across the sector.
neutral	Compared to the previous forecast, the updated quarterly projection implies a new substantial revision of the expected path of the annual inflation rate, following the incorporation of the anticipated impact of the fiscal measures recently adopted by Parliament and currently under re-examination.
neutral	Wages had ceased to be anti-inflationary.
dovish	The MNB would continue the mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes, continuously and for a prolonged period, thus they constituted integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments.
neutral	The projection is one of the inputs to the decision-making process on NBP interest rates.
hawkish	A third scenario, assuming a pick-up in domestic employment and consumption and, consequently, strongergrowth in domestic activity, also implied a tighter monetary policy stance.
dovish	Based on the projection in the June Inflation Report, Hungarian economic performance in 2020 was likely to be more subdued than earlier expected, while the outlook for inflation had shifted downwards persistently.
neutral	In the meeting held today, 6 August 2021, based on the currently available data and assessments, and in light of the elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.25 percent per annum, while preserving tight control over money market liquidity; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 0.75 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 1.75 percent per annum.
dovish	Looking at the cyclical position of the economy, Board members first remarked the strong slowdown in the economy?s rate of increase versus last year.
dovish	There had been a marked fall in oil prices recently.
neutral	The real monetary conditions index was slightly easy in its interest rate component and tight in its exchange rate component. 
dovish	The risks of a further decline in potential growth may have increased, due to companies delaying investment plans.
neutral	The Board devoted part of its discussion to the question of credibility and the question of the interpretation of fulfilment of the 2% inflation target.
neutral	Members arguing for maintaining rates attached much importance to the fact that the central projection had been changed considerably on the relevant horizon relative to November, and that it had been revised down to a level consistent with the inflation target.
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would be in the lower half of the tolerance band around the target until the end of 2014
dovish	This could lead to a lengthier cyclical downturn of the Czech economy and hence to a need to keep monetary conditions accommodative for longer than assumed in the baseline scenario of the forecast.
dovish	GDP growth would temporarily slow to 1.6% in 2011 as a result of fiscal consolidation, a decline in some specific investments and investment in inventories, and slowing growth in external economic activity.
dovish	According to a majority of its members, numerous indicators ? among them household consumption, employment, the average wage and the total volume of wages and salaries ? were rising rather more slowly than forecasted.
dovish	The Bank continued to aim to maintain loose monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through money market rates.
hawkish	The NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 9.0 percent per annum from 8.0 percent.
neutral	Some Council members pointed out that both the current and forecast inflation were close to the inflation target, while core net inflation had remained for a longer period close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target.
dovish	It was said repeatedly that inflation would be in the lower part of the tolerance band for the foreseeable future and that a decline in rates was consistent with this outlook.
hawkish	While analysing the situation in the Polish economy, it was highlighted that the persistent upward trend in industrial output, further increase of economic indicators, and improving situation on the labour market confirmed the continued recovery.
dovish	Weaker-than-expected domestic demand posed downside risks.
neutral	The NBR Board has also decided to ensure an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.
dovish	By contrast, the ECB had decided to extend its quantitative easing programme.
neutral	At the same time, Council members recognized that the findings of the March NBP projection would enable a more comprehensive assessment of medium-term outlook for inflation and economic growth.
neutral	In their opinion, the level of unit labour costs in Poland was currently relatively low, which resulted in very good financial results of enterprises allowing them to absorb growing labour costs without the need to raise their prices. 
neutral	The Board agreed that the uncertainties associated with monetary policy decision-making were this time greater than usual, while the risks were heading in both directions.
dovish	Capital outflows had continued in emerging markets.
neutral	Moving on to discuss inflation developments, Council members agreed that inflation was primarily shaped by temporary effects.
dovish	Weak domestic demand continued to exert a dampening impact on inflation.
hawkish	In the fourth quarter of 2020, the performance of the global economy had been more favourable than expected. 
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, would keep rising over the forecast horizon and would converge to the inflation target in 2011 H1.
dovish	Accompanied by constrained credit supply, household saving might remain high, which might act as a brake on inflation on the demand side.
neutral	Long-term yields had also remained around levels seen at the beginning of the quarter, following a sharp rise due to temporary factors.
hawkish	Inflation risks continued to lie to the upside.
dovish	Some members of the Council emphasized that intensified financial-market turmoil driven by fiscal imbalances in some Western European countries and potential problems faced by financial institutions from European countries could be a more significant threat to domestic economic growth than the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area.
hawkish	The restrictiveness of the entire macroeconomic policy mix will help attain the inflation objectives agreed upon with the government, thus resuming the downward trend in inflation as well as ensuring sustainable economic growth in the medium term.
hawkish	As for economic growth, in 2013, exports were the driving force behind the pick-up in economic activity in Romania, having a further favourable impact on the current account, whereas consumption and investment are envisaged to recover gradually. 
hawkish	References were also made to the recent more favourable performance of China?s economy and to the slight improvement in the prospects of emerging economies, commodity-exporting ones in particular, amid the rebound in demand for commodities and/or in the international prices thereof, fuelled by the anticipated US fiscal stimulus.
hawkish	The most recent data and business surveys point to an ongoing expansion of consumer demand and elevated unit labour costs in industry.
neutral	However, members held the unanimous view that monetary policy should closely monitor potential pass-through into the consumer price index.
hawkish	The increase in headline inflation and core inflation in October had reflected changes in the price index for processed food.
dovish	It was pointed to a strong decline in the growth of corporate and mortgage loans.
neutral	Overall, however, the inflation pressures were no longer increasing.
dovish	It was said several times that inflation in the euro area was significantly below expectations, the price index outlooks were being revised downwards and there was no sign of any change that might have a further negative effect on domestic inflation in the future. 
hawkish	In the monetary area, a revival of non-government credit dynamics is notable mainly due to the faster pace of foreign currency lending growth (foreign currency-denominated loans accounted for 50.6 percent of end-August overall non-government credit).
dovish	The ECB would launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and to maintain favourable bank lending conditions.
neutral	Following the review of macroeconomic and financial market developments, the Monetary Council assessed the central bank programmes and discussed the details of its monetary policy decision.
hawkish	The analyses reconfirm the outlook that annual inflation would remain in the following months above the upper limit of the variation band around the target due to continued excess demand-related pressures as well as prolonged effects of supply-side shocks (mainly fuel and food prices).
neutral	Against this background, members noted the widening of twin deficits, as well as the fact that the current account deficit financing had entirely been covered from foreign direct investment and EU funds.
dovish	Some members of the Council pointed out that the structure of economic growth in 2010 Q1, including the high share of inventory build-up, might signal slower GDP growth in the months to come.
neutral	The current account deficit stood further at a sustainable level, namely below 1 percent of GDP.
dovish	It was added that conditions in global industry were very volatile and deteriorating.
neutral	The Board discussed the effectiveness of transmission from monetary policy rates to the real economy.
neutral	Views were divided on investors? current judgement about the Hungarian economy.
dovish	It was also said that current inflation was below the inflation target and the fact that it was measured using a new index was not relevant, as the new index had brought the consumer basket structure more into line with reality. 
hawkish	Some Council members pointed out that the rate of GDP growth in Poland still exceeds the growth rate of potential output, leading to a widening of the output gap and a build-up in inflationary pressure.
neutral	Members of the Council agreed that current inflation developments, uncertainty about the prospects of economic recovery in Poland and abroad and uncertainty about the situation in the public finance and its impact on inflation justified keeping the NBP interest rates unchanged at the current meeting.
neutral	It was also said that the monetary developments were also signalling no risks of deflation.
dovish	In line with this, real GDP growth would slow from the 6.2% expected this year to 5% in 2008 and then speed up again to 5.6% in 2009.
neutral	The two-week central bank deposit would remain part of the Bank?s instruments; however, the facility would be offered at auctions, with quantity limits.
dovish	The annual growth of the domestic economy ? driven solely by net exports ? had recorded a further noticeable slowdown in 2011 Q4.
dovish	On the one hand, further decline in Polish exports and persisting negative annual growth in industrial output (including the output of intermediate and investment goods), deepening fall in employment in the corporate sector, growing unemployment rate and further decline in bank lending all pointed to the continuation of low activity in the Polish economy.
dovish	The majority of members preferring a rate cut emphasised that the international investment climate had been benign over recent weeks, risk premia on forint assets had fallen back to their levels in May-June and, as implied by the yield curve, market participants expected the Bank to reduce rates more rapidly over the next two years.
hawkish	It was noticed that, on the supply side, the swifter economic growth had benefited from quasi-general support.
dovish	The global economic picture had, however, started to worsen at a fast pace in mid-Q1, while the associated uncertainties had risen substantially, given the rapidly growing adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and global supply chains as well as on demand.
hawkish	Economic growth would be fostered by higher external demand, easy domestic monetary conditions and a recovery in government investment.
dovish	The Board discussed in detail the role of the exchange rate of the koruna as an anti-inflationary factor.
dovish	The risks of the forecast were tilted slightly towards lower inflation and significantly towards lower interest rates.
dovish	The continued decline in oil prices and the fall in processed food prices had contributed to the further easing in inflation.
neutral	Members shared the view that it was crucially important that an agreement between the Hungarian Government and the IMF and EU on a financial safety net for Hungary was reached as soon as possible. 
dovish	Those members also emphasized that the June projection of the NBP pointed at further considerable decline in GDP growth in the coming quarters.
hawkish	The improvement in economic activity in Romania has further been fostered by export growth and the favourable performance of the industrial sector, as well as by the gradual consolidation of consumption.
hawkish	Both corporate and household lending had increased in August.
hawkish	Some of the board members stressed the upside risks to inflation, pointing out that a further pick-up in inflation owing to the increases in VAT and regulated prices might affect hitherto well-anchored inflation expectations, which would result in stronger second-round impacts on inflation. 
dovish	Members agreed that the inflation target was likely to be undershot, assuming that monetary conditions remained unchanged.
dovish	As a consequence, appetite for risk in emerging markets had deteriorated.
hawkish	Part of the discussion was devoted to the overheating of the domestic economy. 
dovish	On the other hand, other Council members argued that there was still a risk of a slowdown in the global economic growth, and that domestic demand was dependent on consumer sentiment, which had once again slightly deteriorated in November, and on the level of public investment, which could be delayed.
hawkish	They indicated that the rapid growth of wages was driving a considerable - and significantly higher than suggested by the NBP April projection - increase in unit labour costs in the economy. 
neutral	The discussion at the meeting focused on the situation in the credit market and in the banking sector as well as on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad.
hawkish	The persistence of negative supply-side effects, high household income dynamics, the projected rise in public spending towards year-end, as well as uncertainties over leu exchange rate movements signal that end-2007 inflation will exceed the upper limit of the 3-5 percent target band.
hawkish	Economic activity continued to rebound in 2021 Q1 at a considerably faster pace than anticipated, albeit slower than in the previous quarter, thus recovering almost entirely the loss incurred in 2020 Q2. 
hawkish	The price of natural gas had more than tripled since the beginning of the summer, while the price of electricity had more than doubled.
neutral	The Bank?s measures of underlying inflation continued to indicate a moderate inflationary environment in the economy.
hawkish	The accelerating money supply growth was also identified as a potential medium-term upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	The Lombard rate was increased.
hawkish	By contrast, the recommendations for wage increases, agreed at the National Interest Reconciliation Council, and rises in the price of oil were exacerbating the upside risks to inflation.
hawkish	Monetary Council members agreed that the global financial market environment had stabilised further, risk appetite had picked up and stability risks had diminished compared to earlier stages of the financial crisis.
dovish	In addition, it was likely that the exchange rate shock would temporarily slow investment activity, and a dampening effect on the labour market could also be expected.
dovish	Monetary Council members agreed that, in the current recessionary environment, the Bank?s 3% target for inflation was likely to be met on the horizon relevant for monetary policy.
neutral	The continued risk aversion of financial investors amid persistent turbulences on international financial markets has weighed on developments in the leu's exchange rate.
hawkish	The significant improvement in economic activity had been reflected mostly in the June data.
dovish	Monetary-policy relevant inflation would be slightly below the inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. 
dovish	At the same time, some Council members noted that, taking into account the increasing percentage of irregular loans, banks would not be willing to ease their lending policies.
hawkish	The Board agreed that the growth of the Czech economy would remain robust.
hawkish	Those members pointed out that acceleration in price growth should also be fuelled by the rise in households? disposable income resulting from the increase in wages, which should support the growth of consumption demand.
hawkish	After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks of the July forecast, which predicted a further rise in interest rates.
dovish	Most major emerging market economies were decelerating.
neutral	On the other hand, uncertainties regarding US trade policy, Brexit and the banking sector situation in some euro area countries were mentioned.
dovish	The growing uncertainties regarding global and European growth amid a worsened global risk appetite and heightened sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone are hindering the short-term outlook for the overall economic activity in Romania.
neutral	It was said repeatedly that according to the new forecast both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation would be close to the inflation target and that such a stable outlook was quite a rare occurrence.
neutral	Some Council members pointed out that the current interest rates level might be appropriate to enable inflation returning to the target over the next few quarters, while interest rate cuts amidst continuing weak economic climate abroad might have limited impact on the domestic economic activity.
hawkish	Therefore, in order to ensure price stability, prevent second-round inflationary effects and anchor inflation expectations, a continuation of the cycle of interest rate hikes with a firm step was warranted.
dovish	Overall, moderate underlying inflation developments continued to point in the direction of a low inflation environment.
dovish	It was said that this reflected households? reluctance to spend combined with government austerity measures.
dovish	Taking these factors into account, all members supported the reduction in the base rate.
neutral	Council members also discussed the size and structure of savings in the economy.
hawkish	The acceleration in growth and the expansionary impact on demand of next year?s budget contributed to the closure of the gap. 
dovish	It was said that new GDP figures confirmed that the economy was in recession.
neutral	The prevailing opinion among the board members was that the current situation ? characterised by lower-than-forecasted GDP, inflation and wages and higher-than-forecasted unemployment ? was not signalling the existence of any demand-pull inflation pressures from the domestic economy.
hawkish	In terms of demand, the recovery had been driven by an increase in household income, a pick-up in government and private investment and the accelerating withdrawal of EU funds.
hawkish	Economic growth would be fostered by accelerating external demand, the easing of the domestic monetary conditions via the weakened exchange rate and exceptionally low interest rates, and higher government investment. 
hawkish	The argument was also made that the appreciation of the Czech currency against the euro was linked with developments in the region and that the decision-making of large financial investors was not based solely on the interest rate differential. 
hawkish	Some Council members pointed out that the increase in inflation expectations is a risk factor for inflation.
neutral	The uncertainty surrounding this outlook arises from both the external environment ? mostly from the geopolitical tensions in the region, the situation in Greece and the euro area, and from the growing divergence between the monetary policy stances pursued by major central banks worldwide ? and the domestic environment.
neutral	It was said repeatedly that the inflation pressures in the wage area were not particularly significant at present.
hawkish	The underlying domestic factors included new information from the labour market, including faster wage growth, along with an upswing in economic growth and higher-than-forecasted inflation.
neutral	In this context, the influence of fundamental factors as well as trends in the international financial markets was considered.
hawkish	Moreover, some discussants argued that the rise in current inflation ? unlike in 2004 ? took place amidst strong economic growth and tight labour market which increased the likelihood of rising inflation expectations and of the so-called second-round effects.
hawkish	Some members of the Council believed that counteracting inflation risk within the monetary policy horizon would require interest rates to be raised at the Council meeting in December.
hawkish	While assessing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that the growth of retail sales and industrial output in February were significantly higher then expected.
dovish	One member noted that the price of crude oil, a key factor in terms of domestic inflation developments, had fallen in recent months due to the slowdown in global activity and further declines in oil prices could not be ruled out.
neutral	The conditions for price stability are assumed to hold if economic agents can expect over a longer period with confidence that inflation remains steadily around the target.
hawkish	Inflation forecasts for the coming quarters had been also revised upwards, which, in the Council?s opinion, indicated the risk that the impact of the pandemic shock on inflationary processes would be more persistent than previously assessed. 
dovish	Attention was given to signals of a possible modest downturn in domestic economic activity in the third quarter of 2007.
hawkish	However, unit labour costs had posted again a faster annual growth or reported further two-digit dynamics in the first four months of 2018, while short-term inflation expectations had continued to see upward adjustments.
hawkish	Furthermore, the Council maintained its assessment that the gradual improvement in economic conditions was likely to continue over the coming quarters, while inflation pressure would remain limited.
dovish	In this regard, it was said that even though the uncertainty associated with expected GDP growth was high, there was spare capacity in the economy and the output gap was significantly negative.
hawkish	According to a majority of the board members, there was a significant risk of them becoming unanchored from the inflation target in the present situation. 
dovish	The NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor defined by interest rates on the NBR?s standing facilities to +/-3 percentage points from +/-4 percentage points. 
dovish	The coronavirus pandemic had hit the global economy in a weakened state; its negative economic effects had appeared quickly in a wide range of countries. 
neutral	While discussing monetary policy abroad, Council members underlined that the tapering of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve was occurring against the background of the ECB stepping up its monetary expansion.
hawkish	It was estimated that economic activity was fuelled by sustained growth in domestic demand.
hawkish	The Hungarian economy had grown strongly, by 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier.
hawkish	Leading and coincidence indicators from the domestic economy remained favourable, especially as regards industrial production, retail sales and lending to the private sector.
neutral	The turmoil on global financial markets and the approval of the fiscal reform were identified as events raising the uncertainty of the decision-making process above its usual level.
dovish	The vast majority of Council members were of the view that in the current situation neither the requirements of inflation targeting nor assessments of risks facing the economy allowed for a reduction in interest rates.
hawkish	The Monetary Council was unanimous in arguing that risks to the inflation outlook remained on the upside.
hawkish	However, the majority of the Council members were of the opinion that amidst further recovery in domestic economic activity and expected continuation of the favourable labour market conditions, as well as probably more lasting impact of the external shocks on price growth, a risk of inflation running above the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon persisted.
neutral	Overall, the effect of these external factors on the domestic economy was approximately neutral, whereas in the previous forecast it had been slightly anti-inflationary.
dovish	At the same time, they argued, core inflation has remained low.
neutral	In this context, the pass-through from monetary policy rates to market rates was discussed.
neutral	Firstly, the latest wage and inflation data did not deviate too much from earlier expectations.
hawkish	They argued that CPI inflation might run at a level higher than that suggested by the central projection path.
neutral	Council members agreed that the current interest rate level continued to be consistent with the sustainable achievement of the inflation target.
hawkish	Domestic demand, in turn, remained relatively robust, supported by a stable expansion in consumer demand and steeper growth in investment spending.
dovish	The situation deteriorated also in the euro area, while in the opinion of some Council members, the pace of this process might indicate that economic slowdown in the euro area was not only driven by the recession in the United States but also by weak domestic demand in the euro area.
dovish	In a much more uncertain than usual and volatile environment, it was the task of economic policy to mitigate the effects on real economy, to lay the foundations for economic recovery and to foster social cohesion.
hawkish	In May 2015, the annual inflation rate climbed to a higher-than-expected 1.2 percent, as volatile prices saw a relative step-up in their annual increase, while the average annual inflation rate was stuck at 0.9 percent for the third month in a row.
neutral	The updated projection of macroeconomic developments shows the annual inflation rate remaining inside the variation band around the central targets of 3 percent in both 2011 and 2012.
hawkish	It was said that domestic demand had rebounded and was showing robust growth, as evidenced by developments in the individual components of GDP, the employment and unemployment figures, a halt in growth in the saving rate, increasing credit growth and positive core inflation. 
neutral	The next subject of debate was the financial condition of corporations.
dovish	Considerable reduction in demand, in particular for the products of exporting enterprises, is also signalled by the results of the NBP business climate surveys.
hawkish	They pointed out that, in the medium term, inflation running above the inflation target would result in Polish economy gradually losing its price competitiveness.
hawkish	When analysing the inflation outlook, the Council members pointed out that in 2022 the annual price growth of consumption goods and services would remain at an elevated level.
dovish	Against this, it was said that the reduction in the budget deficit would probably mean a fall in expenditure and hence a decrease in government consumption.
neutral	They also stressed that as monetary policy transmission mechanism was characterised by considerable time lags, interest rate cuts should not be expected to translate immediately into lending and economic growth.
hawkish	Some agricultural commodity prices and import prices in some sectors were rising.
neutral	Some Board members remarked that overall credit developments were not a source of concern and, if imbalances were noticed on certain segments of lending, it would be analysed whether the implementation of macroprudential measures was warranted.
neutral	While analysing the developments of monetary and credit aggregates, some Council members pointed out that M3 growth was still moderate, similarly to the growth of lending to the private sector, which resulted, on the one hand, from stable growth in lending to households and, on the other hand, from the lack of revival in lending to the corporate sector.
neutral	Members agreed that data becoming available over the recent month had been in line with the baseline scenario of the December projection and no such real economy or financial market event had occurred that would justify a change in the monetary policy.
hawkish	The pick-up in economic activity was attributed to the favourable performance of net exports as well as to the improved domestic demand.
dovish	The prevailing view was that the economy did not currently have room for higher wage growth given the pessimism of domestic economic agents about the future economic situation.
dovish	As expected, annual growth of the Czech economy had slowed to 1.5% in 2014 Q4.
neutral	The Board discussed the outlook for net exports in relation to the recovery in external economic activity.
dovish	It was noted that weaker-than-expected demand was mainly attributable to two factors: the slowdown in earnings growth, closely related to the loose labour market, and the increase in instalments on household debt, driven by the appreciation of the Swiss franc.
neutral	The outlook for external developments was uncertain owing to the deepening global financial market crisis.
hawkish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments reveals ongoing positive annual growth in industrial output and exports. 
hawkish	In this discussion, the opinion was expressed that stronger monetary policy responses would be appropriate primarily in the event of economic shocks. 
hawkish	Some Board members underlined that inflation developments in 2018 had validated the NBR forecasts and the central bank?s monetary policy conduct which had not overreacted to the significant rise seen by the annual inflation rate in the summer months.
neutral	Specifically, the NBR Board unanimously decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum; in addition, the Board unanimously decided to maintain at ñ1.50 percentage points the symmetrical corridor defined by the interest rates on the standing facilities around the policy rate, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, as well as to leave unchanged the minimum reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.
neutral	The majority of the board members regarded the economic situation in Germany as stable and consistent with the forecast. 
dovish	Thus, in the opinion of those Council members, the weakening in economic growth in Poland might turn out significant. 
dovish	The resumption in disinflation has enabled a new cycle of monetary policy easing, in the context of the central bank effectively anchoring inflation expectations and closely monitoring domestic and external developments.
dovish	The Board stated that the fiscal measures would imply a restriction of demand, which would have an anti-inflationary effect.
hawkish	It was concluded that, against that background, labour market tightening had grown significantly stronger of late and that it might persist, given that specialised surveys and analyses showed moderate employment intentions in the near run, but also major difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting skilled labour, as well as an increased staff turnover rate.
neutral	The monetary policy stance aims to fulfil the objectives of price stability over the medium term and financial stability, while also mitigating the adverse impact of external and domestic factors on the economic rebound.
dovish	Some Council members pointed out that the situation in the credit market was not improving: lending to the enterprise sector continued to shrink, while the rise in loans to the household sector remains considerably lower than in the previous years.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic developments shows that the annual dynamics of indicators relevant for the trends in the domestic demand stayed in the negative territory.
neutral	The consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the precautionary external financing arrangement signed with the international financial institutions, along with balanced social and political developments during the electoral year 2014, will help consolidate the stability of the Romanian economy, thereby strengthening its resilience to external shocks.
dovish	The return of inflation to a downward path reflects tighter broad monetary conditions, a favourable base effect, as well as lower prices of fuel and some food products and cheaper telephony rates.
neutral	Under the circumstances, the NBR Board unanimously decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent, the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent.
hawkish	At the same time, some Council members drew attention to the upside risks to inflation.
neutral	The NBR Board is reiterating that it will carefully monitor global economic developments and analyze the effects of persistent international financial market turbulences on the Romanian economy.
hawkish	Investment was likely to continue accelerating, reflecting the increasing use of EU funding and the easing in credit constraints also due to the Bank?s Funding for Growth Scheme.
hawkish	Under the circumstances, the NBR Board unanimously decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent from 1.75 percent, as well as to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.00 percent from 0.75 percent and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.00 percent from 2.75 percent.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic indicators developments reveals a temporary stagnation of disinflation in the context of a consolidation of the slowdown in adjusted CORE2 inflation amid a persistently severe economic contraction, along with a relative improvement of foreign investors? perception regarding the Romanian economy, given the softening tensions in the domestic political field.
neutral	The updated forecast reconfirms the prospects of the annual inflation rate to remain within the variation band around the target throughout the forecast horizon.
hawkish	Some Council members argued that the data on the consumption of households in 2010 Q2 and retail sales indicated that the economic growth, which had so far been mainly reinforced by growing external demand, was increasingly supported by domestic factors.
neutral	The current assessment shows the annual inflation rate remaining inside the variation band around the central target throughout the forecast horizon.
neutral	There was a consensus that the data coming in from the domestic economy were not clear-cut. 
hawkish	Turning to economic growth, the annual GDP dynamics picked up in 2013 Q1 on the back of net exports, whose upturn entailed a marked advance in manufacturing output.
hawkish	As expected, the Fed had decided to raise interest rates and, looking ahead, had moved towards a tighter policy path.
dovish	The recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show a disinflation process consistent with the aim to attain this year's inflation target, a mild slowdown of economic growth dynamics under the negative impact from agriculture as well as a persistent widening of the current account deficit.
hawkish	It was also said that industry was facing increasing problems with staff shortages and that the wage cost-to-output ratio was rising.
dovish	The latest macroeconomic data underscore the inflation rate sticking to low levels, in line with central bank projections.
dovish	Most major emerging market economies were decelerating.
dovish	The Board discussed the causes of the lower-than-forecasted household consumption growth in detail.
dovish	The debt problems in some euro area countries were a downside risk.
neutral	The NBR Board believes that the implementation of the balanced macroeconomic policy mix agreed under the precautionary external financing arrangement will allow a gradual and prudent adjustment of the monetary policy in line with the resumption of the disinflation process and with the consolidation of financial stability.
hawkish	Exports, together with this year?s bumper crops, have been the main driver of the recent economic upturn in Romania, contributing to a substantial correction of the balance-of-payments current account deficit and boosting industrial production.
dovish	Data analysis show that the impact of these developments is already seen in a slowdown of credit to the private sector with knock-on effects on economic growth, while a high degree of uncertainty regarding their magnitude still persists.
neutral	The changes in the regulatory environment considerably distort the data on wages and employment, therefore it would be misleading to rely only on a single indicator; all available information must be used before making the decision.
hawkish	Several members indicated that, based on real-time data for April, further sectors had begun to recover, hence considering base effects a double-digit economic growth was expected in the second quarter.
hawkish	Wage growth had remained dynamic despite the pandemic; and the unemployment rate had remained low by international standards. 
dovish	Particular attention was paid to strong economic slowdown, deteriorating economic conditions indicators and further worsening of consumer sentiment in economies which constitute the main markets for Polish exports ? Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain.
hawkish	The nominal exchange rate was identified as an upside risk to inflation. 
hawkish	It was noted that the relatively swifter economic growth was backed by the recent cuts/removal of taxes/non-tax fees and charges, as well as by the new hikes in wages, pensions and other household income, to which added the accommodative real monetary conditions.
neutral	The prevailing view, however, was that information going beyond the assumptions of the July forecast had also emerged since the forecast was created.
hawkish	However, the depreciation of the forint in recent months passed through gradually into the prices of core inflation items, which in turn pointed to higher underlying inflation.
neutral	The Council discussed the conditions to be fulfilled for Poland to join the euro area.
hawkish	Members agreed that the increase in administered prices could have an adverse effect on consumer prices, particularly in the current inflation environment.
neutral	Looking at the recent developments in the dynamics of consumer prices, Board members showed that the annual inflation rate had remained flat at 4.10 percent in May.
hawkish	Turning to the cyclical position of the economy, Board members remarked that, in Q1, economic expansion had witnessed a stronger-than-anticipated acceleration ? to 5.0 percent from 4.1 percent in 2018 Q4 ?, given an unanticipated rebound in its quarterly dynamics, implying a likely larger advance in excess aggregate demand than the forecast for that period.
dovish	These measures aimed to provide the required amount of liquidity for all economic agents, including households, non-financial corporations, the banking system and the government budget.
dovish	Statistical data confirm the continuation of disinflation and the attainment of NBR's 2006 objective - with year-on-year inflation falling to 4.87 percent in December, below the 5.0 percent target.
dovish	It was said that the demand-pull inflation pressures in the domestic economy would be insignificant this year owing to the absence of GDP growth, fiscal consolidation and also lower household purchasing power because of the VAT increase.
dovish	Economic growth would be dampened by fiscal consolidation, slackening growth in external economic activity, fading investment in inventories and by the debt problems in the euro area and elsewhere. 
hawkish	Another of the upside factors debated was the observed higher agricultural producer price inflation. 
neutral	The opinion was expressed that the change in the shape of the yield curve might also reflect a revision of the economic growth outlook.
hawkish	Some Council members argued that, apart from high wage growth, domestic demand may be additionally driven by growth in credit aggregates, including consumption loans granted to households, which continued at a high level. 
hawkish	Investors? perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive.
neutral	Forward guidance of the world?s leading central banks did not indicate further loosening measures.  
dovish	Most of the board members agreed that the appropriate monetary policy response was to lower rates to technical zero and keep them at this level over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increased significantly.
neutral	These perspectives confirm the need to maintain adequate real broad monetary conditions in line with the anticipated movements in the annual inflation rate throughout the projection horizon.
hawkish	Moreover, Board members considered that, in H2, the annual pace of economic growth would probably exceed that seen in H1, as well as that previously projected, being expected to accelerate in Q3, before slightly slowing in Q4, and thereby carrying the potential for a relatively larger rise in excess aggregate demand.
neutral	The Board discussed in detail developments on the labour market and the reasons why the favourable tendencies in employment and unemployment were not yet being reflected in faster wage growth. 
dovish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth, it was underlined that due to the financial market turbulences the forecasts of economic growth were lowered for the United States, while in Europe there was a decline in business confidence indicators.
dovish	Slowing credit growth might therefore be expected. 
dovish	The decline in real GDP had deepened to -1.7% in Q4, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage point more than had been forecasted. 
hawkish	Moreover, some Council members pointed to the acceleration in wage growth in enterprises in the recent month.
dovish	It was also pointed out that the monetary policy in some countries of the region had been further eased in the recent period.
neutral	The balance of risks associated with global oil prices seemed to be in relative equilibrium.
hawkish	At the same time, some members of the Council assessed that likely continuation of the accommodative monetary policy in some major developed economies would act towards sustained high global liquidity, and, consequently, increased global inflationary pressure.
neutral	Some Council members accepted the inflation outlook outlined in the April projection as probable.
hawkish	In the opinion of some Council members, after the expiry of factors temporarily raising inflation, in the absence of monetary policy tightening, inflation was likely to remain at an elevated level due to the expected increase in domestic wage and demand pressures, including a likely acceleration in unit labour cost growth and the inflation rise abroad.
hawkish	The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy were strong, and convergence to developed economies had continued.
dovish	Falling demand was likely to prevent an increase in inflation expectations. 
dovish	Likewise, the currently very subdued government investment would revert to growth this year.
hawkish	The opinion was expressed that the relatively strong growth in the number of job vacancies was signalling a structural imbalance between labour supply and demand, which in the future might give rise to a shortage of labour in some parts of the market and would foster higher wage growth. 
hawkish	In a debate on the newly published GDP figures it was said that the rapid economic growth was continuing, and the view was presented that a further increase in domestic demand growth could be expected.
hawkish	This represented a positive signal that the domestic economy was generating inflation pressures. 
neutral	Overall, however, the current inflation pressures from the domestic real economy were assessed as moderate.
dovish	In the opinion of some Council members, a significant downward revision of the January inflation, together with markedly lower than expected inflation in February, allowed to assume that inflation might return within the limit for deviations from the NBP?s inflation target sooner than accounted for in the February inflation projection. 
dovish	The Board stated that the slowdown in economic growth owing to the worse external demand outlook could be more significant than forecasted.
dovish	Lower than expected growth in prices in February was driven ? apart from the revision of the CPI basket ? by lower than expected growth in food and fuel prices.
dovish	The faster-than-expected adjustment of the external deficit is correlated with the steeper decline of domestic economic activity amid the effects of the global economic and financial crisis.
hawkish	At the meeting, a motion to raise the key NBP interest rates by 25 basis points was put forward and passed. 
dovish	At the same time, it was pointed out that the annual investment growth in the enterprise sector in 2008 Q3 was negative.
neutral	It was added that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in the long run. 
neutral	Doubts were repeatedly expressed about whether an interest rate reduction would, in the present situation, have the desired effect on lending, the exchange rate and thus inflation at the monetary policy transmission horizon.
neutral	Members voted unanimously in favour of maintaining the base rate at 2.10 per cent.
hawkish	In their analyses, a large part of the Board members were of the opinion that developments in economic growth warranted close scrutiny in terms of potential risks of overheating, although it was pointed out that no such signs had been visible yet.
dovish	The inflation pressures would ease in the period ahead owing to rising labour productivity growth and a renewed anti-inflationary effect of import prices.
dovish	While addressing forecasts, those members argued that inflation in 2009 Q2 and Q3 proved markedly higher than expected in the June projection.
hawkish	It was indicated that the inflation rise in July 2009 to 3.6%, i.e. above the NBP?s inflation target of 2.5% and slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%.
hawkish	It was said during the discussion that it was not appropriate to play a waiting game with the response to the upside risks to inflation and that, at a time of increased uncertainty regarding external developments, monetary policy should be focused on domestic inflation factors, which were associated with less uncertainty. 
dovish	During a discussion of the aggregate demand situation the Board agreed that owing to the turbulence and heightened nervousness in the financial markets there was a risk of lower-than-expected growth abroad and, as a result, weaker external demand.
dovish	According to the forecast, no domestic inflation pressures were currently visible.
neutral	"In view of the above factors, it was recommended to remain cautious, abstain from the decision to change interest rates at the August meeting and adopt a ""wait and see"" approach, following the example of some other central banks."
dovish	While assessing the conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy it was noted that data on the euro area GDP in 2013 Q1 had proven to be weaker than expected and confirmed continuing recession in the euro area.
dovish	Turning to inflation developments, members agreed that after the higher repricing during the summer months, disinflationary effects had strengthened from September. 
dovish	Economic growth would slow in the remainder of 2011 and further in 2012, mainly in response to a contraction in external demand and owing to fiscal consolidation.
hawkish	According to statistical data , year-on-year inflation rose to 6.03 percent in September mainly due to a steep increase in food prices and an adverse impact of the correction in the leu exchange rate against the background of recent turbulence on world financial markets .
neutral	In discussing the monetary policy options, the majority of members agreed that maintaining the base rate was warranted this month based on the macroeconomic projection in the Report.
neutral	In this context, Council members exchanged their opinions concerning the future path of the NBP interest rates.
neutral	Economic growth had been in line with the forecast.
neutral	The Magyar Nemzeti Bank?s Monetary Council decided that, beginning from December 2015, it would issue shorter-form press releases following its policy meetings in the months of publication of the Inflation Report, in order to facilitate comparison of monthly press releases.
neutral	However, most Council members emphasised that in line with the November NBP forecast ? based on conservative assumptions on the scale of energy price increases ? inflation should remain within a band for deviations from the NBP inflation target.
dovish	Following a discussion of the macroeconomic and financial market developments, proposals were submitted to maintain the base rate or to reduce it by 25 basis points.
neutral	The NBR will continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations, leaving unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions.
dovish	By 2009, the real economy was expected to turn anti-inflationary, as a result of a tight exchange rate component of the monetary conditions, restrictive fiscal policy and weaker external demand.
hawkish	The opinion was expressed that the current evolution of the domestic economy was an upside risk to inflation.
hawkish	Some members of the Council indicated that the expansionary monetary policy, including nonstandard measures undertaken by major central banks, coupled with improved sentiment in the financial markets contributed to a strong rise in commodity prices in the global markets, thus intensifying long-term tendencies. 
hawkish	Others, however, judged last month?s jump in services prices and the widening in the gap between manufacturing and service sector wage indices to be bad news for the inflation outlook.
neutral	Taking these factors into account, all members voted unanimously in favour of leaving the base rate, the overnight deposit rate, the overnight lending rate and the one-week lending rate unchanged. 
hawkish	However, the Czech economy was still operating above its potential, while the positive output gap was gradually closing.
dovish	Hungarian economic growth had continued at a weaker-than-expected rate in the third quarter of 2015.
dovish	Several members noted that, according to the evidence of third-quarter data, the slowdown in economic growth had been slightly stronger than expected and that the future outlook for the economy had deteriorated somewhat, due to the worsening in external business conditions.
dovish	In terms of macroeconomic developments, several members noted that the downward effect on prices of weak domestic demand, driven in part by loose labour market conditions, had taken hold.
dovish	The spread of the pandemic resulted in a rapid decline in expected inflation.
dovish	In the Council?s judgement, the outlook for the real economy had not improved, and the risk that domestic macroeconomic consolidation would take longer than elsewhere in Europe had increased.
dovish	Council members agreed that there had been a significant deterioration in the prospects for domestic growth recently.
neutral	The board members also discussed domestic and foreign political risks. 
hawkish	Commodity price rises and their faster pass-through posed upside risks.
dovish	Consequently, a more accommodating monetary policy would ensure that the 3% inflation target was achieved.
neutral	External growth was returning, but there was a risk of renewed slowdown. 
neutral	After the discussion, the Chairman invited members to vote on the two propositions.
dovish	Lending to the private sector saw however negative annual dynamics in real terms, despite a slightly improving trend in lei-denominated loans.
dovish	The annual inflation rate slid for the third consecutive month to reach 4.25 percent in August versus 7.93 percent in June, amid a steep reduction in volatile food prices and the gradual fading-out of the first-round effect of the VAT hike in July 2010.
hawkish	The Council members pointed to the need to take measures aimed at enhancing macroprudential policy, including the development by the central bank and other institutions responsible for the financial system of new instruments mitigating systemic risk in the financial sector.
hawkish	However, it was said in the discussion that domestic economic growth would be higher than forecasted, especially this year, and that other sectors besides the export-oriented manufacturing industry were recovering thanks to the higher external growth. 
neutral	The Board agreed that the risk mentioned in the previous situation report regarding a later external economic recovery was not currently materialising. 
neutral	After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the risks.
dovish	In response to the sharp economic downswing abroad, domestic GDP had fallen in 2009 Q1 by 0.9 percentage point more than forecasted. 
hawkish	Hungary was among the economies in Europe showing the fastest recovery. 
hawkish	Some members pointed out that the price of crude oil had risen back to levels prior to the coronavirus pandemic and that rises in developed country long- term yields had also had a significant effect on emerging regions.
hawkish	The increase in economic activity had been fostered not only by household consumption, reflecting buoyant growth in wages and employment, but also by a marked recovery in investment activity and by foreign trade, driven by rising external demand.
dovish	The labour market was still being affected by the fading recession. 
neutral	The Council members confirmed their assessment that ? given the available data and forecasts ? the current level of interest rates helped to keep the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and to maintain macroeconomic stability.
hawkish	Indicators from the real economy at the start of 2014 Q3 were pointing to continued buoyant economic growth. 
neutral	The NBR restates that achieving price and financial stability objectives in the context of the continued fulfillment of commitments under the external financial accords with the European Union, IMF and other financial institutions is crucial to ensure lasting economic growth in the context of a balanced macroeconomic policy mix.
dovish	Some members took the view that the lower-than-expected GDP data suggested the output gap might be larger than projected in the Report.
dovish	At the same time, also in a bid to appease financial market turmoil, major central banks, as well as central banks in emerging economies, including those in the region, had proceeded to change abruptly or strengthen the path of monetary policy via measures taken, also in emergency meetings, to ease the policy stance and improve the financing conditions for the economy.
dovish	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, the consensus was that the demand pressures from the domestic economy were currently very subdued and would remain anti-inflationary.
dovish	Inflation had continued falling in 2009 Q3, fluctuating well below the lower boundary of the inflation-target tolerance band. 
neutral	The situation report did not identify any major downside risks to inflation.
dovish	It was said in the discussion that GDP growth was lagging behind the fundamentals of the Czech economy and that the weaker growth was due to low sentiment among households and corporations stemming from uncertainty at home and abroad.
neutral	The transposition of the new prudential measures into the internal regulations of credit institutions and non-bank financial institutions should be done within 30 days from their publication in the Official Gazetta.
hawkish	The broader analysis of economic developments shows a relative slowdown of economic growth , attributable to the negative supply-side shock triggered by farming sector output , with consumption remaining at unsustainable levels, as also revealed by the persistent worsening of Romania's external deficit .
neutral	Some members of the Council also addressed changes in the external environment of the Polish economy driven by the financial crisis, which were likely to impact the developments of the equilibrium interest rate in Poland.
dovish	Domestic real economic and labour market factors continued to have a disinflationary impact, and low inflation was likely to persist for a sustained period.
dovish	While analysing the monetary policy abroad and in Poland, it was pointed out that given the absence of clear signs of economic recovery in the euro area, interest rates in this region might be expected to run at a low level for a longer period of time.
hawkish	The economic activity was further bolstered by exports, as well as by the improvement in domestic demand given the increase in household final consumption.
neutral	While addressing the situation in Poland, the members of the Council pointed out that the data on the domestic economic climate were ambiguous.
neutral	There had been differences in the monetary policy stance of globally influential central banks in recent months: the ECB had extended its quantitative easing programme while the Fed had maintained its monetary policy instruments.
neutral	In the opinion of some Council members, the assessment of the balance of risks for future inflation did not provide clear grounds for tightening the monetary policy at the current meeting.
dovish	The inflation rate dropped to an annual 7.3 percent in September from 8.02 percent in the previous month, after the peak of 9.04 percent in July.
hawkish	The upside risks of the new forecast included potentially faster growth in commodity and food prices.
dovish	The slowdown in global economic activity might also lead to some easing of the demand pressures on world prices of food and oil, which in the recent past had risen sharply and had thus contributed to the cost shock to Czech prices.
dovish	The risks to the current inflation forecast were on the downside mainly because of an unexpectedly large year-on-year decline in nominal wages in the business sector in 2013 Q4.
hawkish	According to the central projection based on the ECMOD model, in 2009 CPI inflation would approach the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target (3.5%), while core net inflation would actually reach this level.
neutral	For some of the board members, the main argument for leaving interest rates unchanged was the forecast assumption of rising interest rates over the next two to three quarters and their unwillingness to make such aggressive monetary policy changes in the opposite direction. 
dovish	First, it was noted that the projected annual inflation rate trajectory would stay in negative territory until end-2016 and then below the variation band of the target in the early months of 2017, at values almost similar to those previously forecasted. 
hawkish	Board members deemed that core inflation behaviour hinted at the build-up of inflationary pressures from fundamentals on the demand and cost sides, amid the more pronounced cyclical position of the economy and the hike in unit wage costs.
dovish	Inflation in January had slowed more sharply than expected.
neutral	Maintaining interest rates improved the Bank?s credibility and predictability and fitted well with the Council?s earlier communication.
neutral	Conversely, the arguments for a more cautious approach included concerns of triggering a precipitous weakening of the exchange rate as a possible consequence of a too-large change in domestic rates.
neutral	In this context they pointed at problems of correct specification of this rule and the uncertainty of the estimates of natural interest rate and potential output growth for Poland.
hawkish	Credit expansion has stayed alert in the context of renewed fast growth of foreign currency lending, which accounted for 51.5 percent of the end-September stock of non-government credit.
dovish	It was said several times that the situation in the euro area could be assessed as anti-inflationary owing to reduced outlooks for economic growth, inflation and the interest rate path.
hawkish	Members agreed that there had been a slight reduction in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy and, as a result, investor demand for forint-denominated assets had increased.
neutral	The baseline scenario sees the inflation rate gradually returning inside the variation band of the target and standing in the upper half of the band at the end of the forecast horizon.
dovish	The analysis of the latest macroeconomic developments shows a continuation of the disinflation process and a slowdown of economic growth amid lower investment expansion, especially in the construction sector, diminished industrial output and reduced export orders. 
dovish	This trend, in line with the central bank's forecasts in the latest Inflation Report, strengthens the favourable outlook for the annual inflation rate to fall below the 2.5 percent target in the forthcoming period.
neutral	The evolution of oil prices was a significant source of uncertainty in both directions.
hawkish	In the context of the assessment of external developments it was said that the higher economic growth combined with the lower expected inflation perhaps suggested growth in potential output without the need to tighten monetary policy.
dovish	Some Council members assessed that the decline in China?s economic growth could translate ? through its adverse impact on the outlook for German exports ? into a slowdown in the Polish exports.
dovish	And with the expected deterioration in economic conditions and the associated slackening in demand, downward effects on inflation could be intensifying.
dovish	Core inflation, excluding the effects of excise duties on tobacco and alcohol, dropped further - to 2.65 percent year-on-year in June from 2.7 percent in the month before and 3.0 percent in December 2006 - as broad monetary conditions remained restrictive against the background of a more pronounced appreciation of the leu.
dovish	The NBR Board decided to lower the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities with residual maturities of up to two years.
hawkish	Economic activity will still be supported by stable consumption growth, accompanied with a further rise in investment growth rate.
neutral	Hungarian economic output was close to its potential level.
hawkish	While referring to domestic economic activity, Council members noted that GDP data had confirmed the continuation of a gradual recovery in 2013 Q3.
neutral	The historical statistical indicators may have been deflected by the extreme growth shocks and might be less reliable than under normal circumstances. 
hawkish	While discussing inflationary developments, Council members stressed the fact that ? like in other countries ? heightened inflation had been largely driven by external factors, including rising global prices of energy commodities, which translated into higher prices of energy, and in particular into higher prices of fuels.
hawkish	The appreciation of the koruna had led to a tightening of the exchange rate component of the monetary conditions equivalent to an interest rate increase of 3/4 to 1 percentage point, but on the basis of the forecast the interest rate component of the monetary conditions could also be tightened somewhat.
dovish	They pointed out that some forecasts indicated the possibility of economic growth weakening in 2011 or stabilising at a relatively low level in the next two years.
neutral	Some of the board members argued that this uncertainty was acting in both directions. 
dovish	While addressing the labour market situation, members of the Council pointed to persisting unfavourable trends, including in particular the growth in registered unemployment and the continuing negative annual employment growth, as well as the decline in real wages in the enterprise sector in October 2009.
neutral	The majority of the board members agreed on the overall assessment of the January forecast risks as being balanced. 
dovish	It was mentioned repeatedly that, unlike headline inflation, adjusted inflation excluding fuels as an indicator of domestic demand-pull inflation pressures was still below the inflation target. 
hawkish	The inflationary factors had included published data on higher household consumption and slightly faster wage growth, a higher outlook for food price inflation and a higher outlook for regulated price inflation due to an expected increase in electricity prices.
dovish	The emergence of the coronavirus was likely to increase uncertainty in the coming months, which could lead to a deterioration in global growth prospects again and an increase in risk aversion in emerging markets.
dovish	The upward effect of this on costs was likely to be offset by the reduction in employers? social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate.
hawkish	Data released after the Report had been finalised reinforced the view that developments in nominal wages represented upside risks to inflation.
hawkish	Several members noted that the fiscal adjustment measures expected during the latter part of the year, the higher-than-expected global oil prices and the unfolding food price shock represented additional upside risks to inflation.
hawkish	According to the available data, the annual growth of the domestic economy had accelerated sharply to 4.2% in 2015 Q1, more than double the forecasted rate of growth.
dovish	Consequently, the first interest rate hike had been shifted to a later date.
dovish	Growth had been slightly slower than projected in the June Inflation Report, presumably as a result of the weaker agricultural output. 
neutral	Over the long term, prospects for convergence with the euro area remained plausible, assuming larger capital stock and infrastructure development.
neutral	In late 2009 and early 2010, inflation would then be at the 2% inflation target valid from 2010.
dovish	Some Council members assessed that the scale of the economic slowdown in Poland may be larger than forecasted in the February NECMOD projection.
hawkish	In the discussion about interest rates, a majority of the board members agreed that the monetary policy tightening decision had moved much closer since the last meeting.
hawkish	Developments in the euro area were acting in the inflationary direction via the expected path of one-year Euribor rates.
hawkish	In June, industrial production had risen relative to the previous month and the same period a year earlier.
hawkish	Some Council members assessed that GUS data concerning the growth of wages in the corporate sector in April 2007 and wages in the economy as a whole in 2007 Q1 confirmed that wage growth has been accelerating.
neutral	The majority of members took the view that economic performance had been broadly in line with the May projection and there had been little change in the outlook for inflation.
hawkish	Other Council members emphasised that a gradual recovery of economic growth should translate into higher demand, while the negative output gap might close up earlier than anticipated.
neutral	While discussing the changes in the environment of the Polish economy, it was pointed out that considerable uncertainty persisted as to the assessment what effects the turmoil in international financial markets would have on the outlook for growth and inflation in the global and Polish economies. 
dovish	One of the members, however, argued that, due to the reduction of the required premium, the time had come for an immediate 25 basis-point cut.
dovish	They also reconfirm the prospects of a slowdown in both headline and core inflation rates, along with the downward adjustment in inflation expectations, in the coming months.
neutral	Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate.
hawkish	On the other hand, some Council members emphasised that in certain developed economies the interest rate hiking cycle had already begun. 
hawkish	It was therefore necessary to tighten monetary conditions further.
neutral	The opinion was expressed that the economic crisis had not affected the long-run rate of growth of potential output. 
hawkish	It was said several times that financial stability-related macroprudential considerations also spoke in favour of raising rates.
hawkish	In the discussion of the starting points of the forecast, it was said that the economy was going through a phase of dynamic economic growth, which, unlike in the past, was being accompanied by an economic upswing abroad.
neutral	The CNB stood ready to use its instruments to mitigate potential excessive exchange rate fluctuations if needed.
neutral	Some of the board members expressed the view that the economic recovery was unbalanced not only abroad, but also in the domestic economy, and that it was being driven predominantly by exporters.
dovish	However, it was also said that a timely interest rate cut was the appropriate monetary policy response.
neutral	In December, headline inflation had hit the 2% target following four years of exceptionally low values. 
hawkish	Strong credit growth had continued. 
dovish	Members of the Council pointed out that tensions connected with the deep fiscal imbalance gradually spread to other countries and in the future might affect major developed economies.
dovish	In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 7.5 percent per annum from 8.0 percent.
neutral	The initial inflationary pressures stemming from the domestic economy were not significant, owing to weak domestic demand.
neutral	One member commented that price stability has already been achieved and inflation over the forecast horizon is expected to be in line with the inflation target set out based on the MNB Act. 
hawkish	The Monetary Council was prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which would begin with the modification of unconventional instruments.
dovish	The domestic economy was continuing to decline from the peak of the business cycle.
hawkish	It was shown that the implementation, be it even partial, of these measures would lead to an overheating of the economy and that the adverse effects might become manifest/strengthen over the medium and long term, especially if public investment were to be further postponed.
dovish	To ensure this, in November 2017, the Council had decided to introduce two unconventional instruments from January 2018, which would constitute an integral part of the Bank?s set of monetary policy instruments.
dovish	This development was further underpinned by fundamentals, namely the persistence of the negative output gap and the maintenance of inflation expectations inside the variation band of the target.
neutral	Currently, by contrast, inflation had reached roughly the level that the CNB had considered optimal when the exchange rate had been introduced.
dovish	It was mentioned that the outlook for external demand was deteriorating significantly and the effects of the financial crisis would undoubtedly also appear in Europe.
dovish	It was observed that, in the first two months of 2018 Q4 overall, the advance in credit to the private sector had continued at a sustained pace, marginally above the Q3 average.
neutral	In the Council?s judgement, the current level of interest rates was appropriate to achieve the inflation target in the medium term and ensured a corresponding degree of stimulus to the real economy, and therefore no change was required.
dovish	The factor favouring the decision to ease the monetary policy was maintaining the public finance discipline amidst the expected economic slowdown declared by the government?s representatives.
neutral	On the other hand, few members of the Council indicated that considering the NBP?s March projection of inflation and its balance of risks, in mid-2013 inflation should come close to the target.
dovish	Yet, some Council members pointed out that the data on industrial output in December 2009 fell significantly short of expectations. 
hawkish	Board members remarked that the step-up in economic activity had been accompanied by a robust increase in the number of employees economy-wide and a fall in ILO unemployment rate to a post-crisis low, hinting at further labour market tightening. 
neutral	The Board then discussed lending activity.
hawkish	The trade deficit had widened considerably faster than in the same year-earlier period, also triggering a deepening of the current account deficit in annual terms, despite the improvement, in that period, in the primary and secondary income balances.
hawkish	Council members pointed out that the Polish economy is in the stage of strong economic growth and that the high GDP growth may be expected to be sustained in the medium term, at least.
dovish	It was argued that following a rise observed in August 2010, the subsequent months recorded a drop in the majority of measures of household inflation expectations which were currently at the level close to the NBP's inflation target. 
neutral	The latest macroeconomic data show the inflation rate moving in line with the central bank?s previous forecasts and the prospects of its falling within the target band once the statistical effects of the summer 2012 supply-side shocks fade away.
hawkish	Market expectations on both the ECB?s and the Fed?s interest rate path had shifted up.
hawkish	Other discussants, however, assessed that inflation may prove higher than that indicated by the projection, due to the projection?s possible underestimation of wage and GDP growth.
neutral	Old?ich D?dek emphasised that the Czech Republic was not visibly out of line with the rest of the EU in terms of HICP inflation, so there did not seem to be anything specific in domestic inflation requiring a firm monetary policy response.
neutral	They were being balanced by the strengthening exchange rate and continued subdued growth in foreign prices.
hawkish	Going forward, this could be reflected in higher productivity and competitiveness.
hawkish	All components of demand except net exports had contributed to the year-on-year increase in GDP. 
hawkish	Therefore, a precondition for meeting the 2009 inflation target was that the Bank should stand ready to tighten policy in order to prevent a rise in expectations, if circumstances warranted it.
dovish	Some of the board members expressed concerns about potential persistence of the adverse consequences of the mortgage crisis for the financial sector and about a possible future slowdown in euro area growth.
neutral	In this extraordinary macroeconomic environment, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank?s (MNB?s) mandate was still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government?s economic policy.
hawkish	Over the medium term, buoyant domestic demand and the increase in wage costs would point to an increase in domestic core inflation.
hawkish	The analysis of the most recent statistical data reveals a continued high dynamics of domestic demand as investments picked up and consumption remained at an unsustainable level in the context of a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector, especially foreign currency loans.
neutral	Inflation targeting is a monetary policy framework where the central bank?s primary objective is to achieve price stability, which it seeks to reach with a publicly announced inflation target.
hawkish	Following the analysis, Board members found that the current context called for further adjustment of the monetary policy stance via an increase in the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 2.00 percent.
dovish	The decline in employment had deepened further and unemployment had increased. 
hawkish	It was said several times that unemployment was coming down fairly rapidly and that this might signal the onset of wage inflation pressures. 
neutral	It was noted that the annual inflation rate had ceased to rise in March, staying relatively steady at 0.18 percent, but that in Q1 as a whole it had gone up in line with the projection.
hawkish	It was said repeatedly that the combination of rising indirect tax rates, regulated rents, energy prices and food prices would affect headline inflation.
neutral	Inflation expectations had remained anchored.
hawkish	In the Monetary Council?s view, the tightening of interest rate conditions was also supported by the reduction in the target amount of weekly purchases under the government securities programme from HUF 50 billion to HUF 40 billion.
dovish	Based on Q3 data, the slowdown in economic growth seemed to be slightly stronger than expected, and the recovery was likely to be more modest than previously thought, due to the prospective slowdown in external economic activity.
hawkish	While justifying this decision, Council members argued that in the coming quarters price growth would rise slowly, which would be driven by stable economic growth and the gradual closing of the output gap.
dovish	Due to the deteriorating economic outlook in Europe and downside risks to inflation related to the euro area, the European Central Bank (ECB) had modified its forward guidance. 
hawkish	Members agreed that the upside risks to inflation had increased significantly in recent months.
neutral	While discussing developments in Poland?s real economy, attention was drawn to the preliminary release of GDP data for 2016, which indicated that the annual GDP growth rate in 2016 Q4 had been close to that recorded a quarter earlier.
hawkish	The consumer price index was expected to rise significantly, reflecting the effects of increases in VAT and excise duties as well as the rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the forint exchange rate in the second half of 2011.
hawkish	The prevailing view among the board members was that given the environment of solid economic growth, rapid wage growth, a weaker koruna and inflation in the upper half of the tolerance band, it was appropriate to tighten monetary policy further via interest rates. 
hawkish	Inflation had picked up in September, largely reflecting rises in food and fuel prices. 
hawkish	 As a result of the earlier opening than the European average, the restart of the economy was expected to pick up significantly in the second quarter, which would support a rapid recovery of Hungarian GDP.
hawkish	Year-on-year inflation climbed to 4.96 percent in August, close to the upper limit of this year's target band, due to a significant increase of food prices and a correction of the leu's exchange rate against the background of recent turbulences on the world financial markets.
dovish	Lower-than-expected growth abroad and an escalation of the debt problems of certain euro area countries were sources of increased uncertainty. 
hawkish	It was concluded, on the other hand, that the action of fundamentals would probably be slightly more inflationary over the short time horizon than previously anticipated, given the somewhat stronger pressures expected to be exerted by aggregate demand, wage costs and short-term inflation expectations.
neutral	Some members of the Council emphasized that although the coming months were likely to bring a further rise in CPI inflation due to factors independent of domestic monetary policy such as increases in most VAT rates, inflation might be expected to fall in the second half of 2011.
dovish	Council members agreed that the gradual reduction in debt stocks accumulated during the years prior to the crisis, the generally tight credit conditions and the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for activity all pointed to cautious investment and consumption decisions.
neutral	In the discussion that followed the presentation of the situation report, a majority of the board members assessed the risks to the current forecast as being balanced and insignificant. 
hawkish	Despite the pick-up in domestic demand, capacity utilisation was expected to improve only gradually due to the protracted recovery in Hungary?s export markets.
neutral	After the presentation of the situation report, the Board discussed the new forecast and the risks associated with it. 
neutral	The Board discussed the January situation report containing the new forecast for inflation and other macroeconomic indicators.
dovish	Recent developments in high-frequency indicators point to a standstill in economic activity in 2021 Q4, also in the context of the fourth pandemic wave, the energy crisis and supply bottlenecks, entailing the fall in annual GDP dynamics to a significantly lower value than that anticipated in November 2021.
dovish	Members judged that the decline in foreign currency lending by commercial banks would pose a severe problem.
neutral	As a result, inflation was expected to stabilise around the central bank target again.
hawkish	It was observed that the global rebound in activity was contributing to the rise in prices of many commodities, including energy commodities and metal prices, which were currently significantly higher than a year earlier.
neutral	The Board agreed that the recovery in the Czech Republic would be driven primarily by exports.
hawkish	The international rating agency Fitch has upgraded Hungary?s long-term government debt rating to investment grade.
hawkish	In the Council?s assessment, Hungarian economic growth picked up over the forecast horizon.
hawkish	Wage inflation was not yet showing signs of slowing, particularly in the services sector, which was of particular importance for future developments in inflation.
hawkish	The most recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show the persistence of high dynamics of economic growth and productivity underpinned by investment and consumption expansion, the latter also triggering a widening of the current account deficit.
dovish	It was pointed out that the recession in the euro area, which is Poland?s main trading partner, would lead to the lowering of demand for Polish exports.
hawkish	Strong credit growth had continued in February.
dovish	The growth of the Czech economy would slow in the quarters ahead due to weak growth in external demand and would return close to its potential rate at the end of next year.
neutral	Future measures would be influenced by developments in the outlook for inflation over a 5-8 quarter horizon, which was assessed by the Monetary Council with special attention quarter to quarter. 
dovish	International investor sentiment had been mostly unfavourable in the period since the Council?s latest interest rate decision.
neutral	Taking into account that developments in the macroeconomy and financial markets had been generally in line with the projection since the latest policy decision, the overwhelming majority of decision-makers did not see a case for change of the forward guidance.
neutral	Moreover, the unanimous opinion was that fiscal and income policy prospects remained uncertain until the 2016 budget execution features were released and, more importantly, the 2017 budget construction that would outline the future stance of the two policies became available. 
dovish	In this respect, some members noted that if the risks associated with the short-term path of inflation diminished, then monetary policy should pay more attention in the future to risks of a potentially sharp slowdown in the economy.
neutral	Based on the latest wage data it is still not clear that the risk of sticking wage inflation became lower.
dovish	The inflation outlook reveals a slowdown trend in the year-on-year inflation rate.
neutral	However, inflation was expected to approach levels around the 3 per cent target only towards the end of the forecast period, reflecting moderate underlying inflation.
neutral	The Bank?s primary objective was to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner.
neutral	At the forecast horizon inflation would be falling towards the inflation target after the unwinding of the effect of the tax and price shocks that occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, thanks to the anti-inflationary effect of the current appreciation of the koruna and a gradual decline in inflation pressures from the domestic economy.
hawkish	Economic growth will be supported by expected rise in investment resulting from higher inflows of EU funds, amid a steady rise in consumption.
dovish	The inflation outlook reveals a slowdown trend in the year-on-year inflation rate starting August as a result of a base effect as well as of the maintenance of restrictive monetary conditions.
dovish	The Council expected weak demand conditions to persist, ensuring that inflationary pressures in the economy remained low in the period ahead. 
dovish	By contrast, the lower-than-expected wage growth at the end of 2007 could be termed a downside risk in relation to the forecast.
neutral	The 2009 target, also assumed by the government, is in line with the need to achieve a sustainable medium-term inflation rate in the context of the ongoing convergence with the European Union - a process that requires sustained financial and economic efforts underpinned by an adequate macroeconomic policy mix.
dovish	It was noted that, after the pick-up seen in August, the annual inflation rate had witnessed a somewhat larger-than-anticipated drop in September, down to -0.57 percent, as a result of the large decline in prices for vegetables, eggs and fruit. 
neutral	Several members noted that the distribution of risks around the baseline projection in the Report might be more balanced.
neutral	In the assessment of some Council members balanced risks to future inflation should indicate that the interest rates in the coming months would remain unchanged, which does not rule out the possibility of their adjustment in case of developments that would significantly affect the outlook for inflation and economic growth.
neutral	The meeting opened with a presentation of the April situation report and the new forecast for inflation and economic developments.
dovish	It was also pointed out that global economic slowdown had been accompanied by a strong decline in the prices of oil and other commodities which was conducive to curbing global inflation.
hawkish	In the opinion of some members of the Council, tight labour market reflected in the rapid decline in unemployment rate and a swift labour demand growth would not diminish significantly in the time to come due to economic emigration of Poles and persisting differences in the level of wages between Poland and Western European countries.
neutral	The board members agreed that the referendum result primarily implied an increase in uncertainty and that the main economic impacts associated with the probable Brexit lay beyond the monetary policy horizon, so they were not particularly relevant to current decision-making.
dovish	The feeble dynamics of industrial production and retail trade, as well as the protracted euro area recession entailing adverse effects on Romanian exports suggest the persistence of the negative output gap.
dovish	The analysis of macroeconomic and financial indicators shows a significant slowdown of economic growth against the background of deepening of the global crisis as well as the ongoing, rapid adjustment of the external imbalance, which however has yet to reach sustainable longer-term levels.
hawkish	In terms of demand and supply, the Hungarian economy exhibited the potential for a rapid recovery.
neutral	After discussing the situation report, the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 2.50%.
neutral	The annual headline inflation rate had been 2.5% in August, the same as in the previous month.
neutral	However, the opinion was also expressed that the forecast reflected all the available information and that no additional downside risks were visible.
hawkish	Several members noted that the rise in international commodity prices and global inflationary pressures played a major role in this development, which, however, could be even more sustained than assumed in the May Report.
dovish	At the same time it decided to lower the discount rate and Lombard rate by the same amount, to 2.50% and 4.50% respectively.
neutral	In addition to the primary goal of meeting the inflation target, the Council also considered the condition of the real economy and incorporated financial stability aspects into its decisions.
dovish	The overwhelming majority of members agreed that the Council would have scope for reducing interest rates further if future economic conditions reflected a reduction in the risk of higher inflation transmitted through expectations and an improvement in international investor sentiment towards the Hungarian economy.
hawkish	Nevertheless, the risk of a prolonged deviation of inflation from the target through part of 2008 tends to diminish the favourable impact of this consolidation and to affect the inflation expectations of corporates and households.
neutral	Though the June inflation data indicated a somewhat downward trend compared to the previous two months, the rate of increase does not exceed the characteristic noise of the data.
neutral	According to the February forecast, both headline inflation and monetary-policy relevant inflation would be close to the inflation target at the monetary policy horizon.
neutral	Consequently, inflation might come close to the 3% target.
dovish	In the opinion of some Council members, considerable deterioration in the external environment of the Polish economy and a risk of significant decline in investment and consumption demand due to deteriorating expectations about future economic situation in Poland suggested that in 2009 GDP growth in Poland might prove lower than anticipated in the NBP?s October projection. 
hawkish	Export growth was expected to continue in line with the rate of growth of external demand, which was projected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year.
neutral	In this context, the board members drew attention to the experience of other countries, for example Germany, as well as the past experience of the Czech Republic with incomplete pass-through of cost shocks into inflation. 
neutral	On the domestic front, the macroeconomic policy mix is conditional on the manner in which the recently approved or announced fiscal and budgetary measures (the new Tax Code and pay rises) will be transposed into the 2016 budget configuration and execution.
dovish	In the opinion of those Council members the strong decline in inflation would be driven primarily by base effects connected with high increases in regulated prices at the beginning of 2009 and by a decline in import prices being the result of the hitherto observed zloty appreciation, which will also contribute to the decline in core inflation. 
dovish	It was said that it was appropriate to continue with the easy monetary policy as currently configured.
neutral	There were both upside and downside risks to developments in investment, and consequently to the future path of the economy?s potential output.
neutral	The majority of members judged inflation risks to be symmetrical, and therefore felt that a decision to change the policy stance was not warranted.
dovish	It was concluded that the balance of risks to short-term evolution of administered prices was tilted to the downside.
dovish	Other members of the Council pointed out, however, that the persisting relatively high unemployment would be a factor limiting wage growth in the economy.
hawkish	Core inflation was likely to rise gradually as a result of an expansion in domestic demand and rises in wages.
neutral	The Council also analysed the impact of the NBP?s interest rates on long-term interest rates. 
neutral	Overall, the Board agreed that wage growth seemed to be a two-sided risk.
hawkish	The Council also discussed the right time for a possible further tightening of monetary policy.
hawkish	Statistical data also illustrate that the dynamics of nominal wage earnings and unit labour costs in the industrial sector stayed on an upward trend.
hawkish	Council members unanimously underlined that the cycle of interest rate hikes should be executed on a monthly basis.
dovish	A majority of the board members felt that the risks to future inflation were tilted to the downside compared with the baseline scenario of the forecast.
dovish	In the past period, several regional central banks had sent a message indicating a looser policy stance.
dovish	While addressing the changes in external factors affecting the Polish economy, the discussants pointed at further deterioration in the outlook for economic growth in the United States.
hawkish	The higher-than-expected rise in private sector gross wages in January could not be clearly attributed to a pick-up in wage inflation.
hawkish	In addition to high prices of commodities and energy, these pressures reflected persisting problems in global production chains. 
dovish	On the external front, worth noting is the escalating uncertainty about the euro area economic recovery, stemming from the ongoing slowdown of the Chinese economy and of other major emerging economies, as well as from the geopolitical tensions, which is likely to pose risks to Romania?s economic growth.
neutral	The NBR Board decisions aim to preserve price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent ñ1 percentage point flat inflation target, in a manner supportive of the recovery of economic activity in the context of fiscal consolidation, while safeguarding financial stability.
dovish	In view of the March Inflation Report projection, the Council assessed that the sustainable achievement of the inflation target had made it necessary to implement a comprehensive easing of monetary conditions.
neutral	Members agreed that financial market developments had recently been driven mainly by information related to the growing use of the coronavirus vaccine as well as by parallel changes in economic prospects. 
neutral	The opinion was expressed that the risk to lending to the domestic economy posed by the deleveraging in the euro area and the fulfilment of the new regulatory requirements by European banks was not yet clear.
neutral	Some members remarked that it was not clear which path crude oil prices would follow.
neutral	Monetary-policy relevant inflation was in the upper half of the tolerance band around the inflation target.
dovish	To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council had launched its corporate bond purchasing programme.
hawkish	In the Council?s judgement, economic growth was likely to pick up gradually in the coming quarters.
neutral	Adjusted inflation excluding fuels had stayed positive and stable despite fade-out of the direct effect of the weakened exchange rate of the koruna against the euro and still subdued inflation abroad.
hawkish	The majority of Council members assessed that in order to keep inflation close to the target in the medium term, it is necessary to tighten the monetary policy at the present meeting. 
dovish	While discussing developments in consumer prices of goods and services, a marked decline in annual CPI inflation in February 2010 was pointed to, driven by a fall in annual price indices of fuel, energy commodities and food, and by a decline in core inflation.
hawkish	Mention was also made of the upside risks induced by a possibly higher increase in corporate costs, along with tighter profit margins, due mostly to the new fiscal and income-related measures, as well as to labour market tightening.
dovish	While analysing economic situation in Poland, the Council members pointed out that the deceleration of industrial production, a further decline in construction output and weaker retail sales growth indicate that Poland?s GDP growth continues to decrease.
neutral	Nine members voted to maintain the base rate and four members voted for a 25 basis point increase.
hawkish	Higher-than-expected and sustained increases in commodity prices were rapidly being incorporated into consumer prices in a buoyant domestic demand environment, leading to rising inflation in general.
neutral	It was also said several times that it was good idea to wait for more data to confirm positive tendencies in the economy.
hawkish	Board members deemed that the Q3 developments pointed to a new increase, significantly above expectations, in excess aggregate demand, probably moderated somewhat by the temporary pick-up in potential GDP in that interval, under the impact of the positive supply-side shock from bumper crops.
neutral	In the Council?s assessment, maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions at both the short and long ends for an extended period was necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner.
neutral	Given their substantial share in the current rise in inflation, food prices were an important subject of debate.
hawkish	The upside risks included the possibility of the current higher-than-expected inflation feeding through into inflation expectations and subsequently into inflation. 
dovish	The analysis of the most recent trends in macroeconomic indicators shows a continuation of the disinflation process, a relatively slower economic growth and a widening of the current account deficit against the background of persistently high dynamics of domestic absorption.
hawkish	The inflationary signals from the domestic and external economies had pushed the inflation forecast upwards compared to April.
dovish	When discussing the situation in the financial markets, it was pointed out that growing concerns about the global economic activity had boosted investor expectations of further monetary policy easing by major central banks.
hawkish	However, the annual inflation rate continues to stay above the upper limit of the variation band around the target.
dovish	Consistent with the forecast was a decline in interest rates.
dovish	Among the factors increasing the uncertainty about the sustainability of economic growth acceleration some members of the Council mentioned the hitherto observed absence of recovery in corporate investment.
neutral	Monetary policy had thus helped inflation to step back from the edge of deflation, the threat of which, in the light of developments abroad, had been even greater than suggested by the analyses available a year ago. 
dovish	A number of the board members nevertheless expressed doubts about the resumption of investment growth in 2016 H2 assumed in the forecast. 
hawkish	Members unanimously argued that the effects of the global increase in energy prices were being felt in an increasingly wide range of consumer prices.
dovish	While discussing the outlook for economic growth in Poland, it was pointed out that December data on industrial output and retail sales were significantly below expectations.
hawkish	Turning to developments in Poland's real economy, the Council members pointed out that annual GDP growth had accelerated to 4.9% in 2017 Q3, i.e. it was higher than envisaged in the projection.
neutral	These decisions are meant to ensure price stability over the medium term in line with the 2.5 percent ñ1 percentage point flat target, along with creating favourable conditions for the sustainable recovery of lending, which is likely to help achieve balanced and lasting economic growth.
neutral	The overall inflation pressures from the real economy were thus now described in a more structured way by means of the real marginal cost gap, consisting of the real wage gap and a redefined output gap.
dovish	By contrast, the indicators of the domestic real economy were generally anti-inflationary: annual GDP growth had been 0.7 percentage points lower than forecasted, the decline in total employment had increased, and wage growth had been lower than expected.
neutral	The NBR Board reaffirms that a firm and consistent implementation of the macroeconomic policy mix ? monetary, fiscal and income- as well as of the structural reforms agreed under the multilateral external financing arrangement with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions is essential for achieving a further sustainable disinflation, maintaining financial stability and for a lasting and sustainable relaunch of economic activity.
hawkish	In the Monetary Council?s assessment, the upside risks related to the outlook for inflation had generally increased.
hawkish	The improved investor sentiment coupled with the shift to adequate liquidity management in the banking system caused money market rates and yields on government securities to decline and gradually near the monetary policy rate, thus strengthening the policy rate transmission.
